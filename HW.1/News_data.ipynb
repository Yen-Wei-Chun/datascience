      "[{'date': '2019-05-05', 'title': 'Theresa May urges Jeremy Corbyn to do a Brexit deal', 'content': 'Theresa May has called for Jeremy Corbyn to \"put their differences aside\" and agree a Brexit deal. The UK was supposed to leave the EU on 29 March - but the deadline was delayed until 31 October, after MPs rejected Theresa May\\'s withdrawal agreement three times. Mrs May is now seeking Labour support to get an agreement through Parliament. Writing in the Mail on Sunday, she said they should \"listen to what voters said\" in Thursday\\'s local elections. The Conservatives lost 1,334 councillors, while Labour failed to make expected gains, instead losing 82 seats. The Liberal Democrats benefited from Tory losses, gaining 703 seats, with the Greens and independents also making gains. The prime minister blamed the Brexit impasse for the losses - but said the elections gave \"fresh urgency\" to find a way to \"break the deadlock\". Mrs May said she hopes to find a \"unified, cross-party position\" with Labour - despite admitting that her colleagues \"find this decision uncomfortable\" and that \"frankly, it is not what I wanted either\". Talks between Labour and the Conservatives are to resume on Tuesday. According to the Sunday Times, Mrs May is willing to compromise on three areas: customs, goods alignment and workers\\' rights. The paper says she could put forward plans for a comprehensive, but temporary, customs arrangement with the EU that would last until the next general election. The BBC\\'s political correspondent Chris Mason said reaching a deal was \"fraught with risk\" for both Mrs May and Mr Corbyn. \"A deal on a customs union would be deeply divisive for the Conservatives,\" he said. \"Accepting there\\'d be no new referendum would split Labour.\" Sir Graham Brady, the chairman of the 1922 committee of Tory backbenchers, told the Daily Telegraph that staying in a customs union could lead to a \"catastrophic split\" in the Conservative Party. And, in the same paper, Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage said: \"If the Tories do a deal with Labour on the customs union they will be going into coalition with the opposition against the people.\" He told Sky News\\' Sophy Ridge on Sunday programme that millions of people would give up on Labour and the Conservatives if they agreed a deal, adding it would be the \"final betrayal\". Meanwhile, the People\\'s Vote campaign -  which wants a referendum on a final Brexit deal - has published a letter signed by more than 100 opposition MPs saying any new, agreed deal should be put to the public for a vote. \"The very worst thing we could do at this time is a Westminster stitch-up, whether over the PM\\'s deal or another deal,\" the letter read. On Saturday, former Conservative leader Iain Duncan Smith said a deal with Labour would not be legitimate. \"As a result of the devastating [local] election result, the PM has in effect become a caretaker,\" he told the BBC. \"As such, she is not empowered to make any deal with the Labour Party which itself suffered a very similar result. Two discredited administrations making a discredited deal is not the answer to the electorate.\"'}, {'date': '2019-05-05', 'title': \"Newspaper headlines: Could there be a 'last-ditch' Brexit deal?\", 'content': 'There\\'s widespread coverage of Theresa May\\'s message to Jeremy Corbyn that it\\'s time to \"do a deal\" on Brexit. Her appeal to \"come together in the national interest\" and compromise to \"get Brexit over the line\" is made in a piece in the Mail On Sunday. The Sunday Express suggests Brexiteer MPs have condemned the idea of such a deal as a \"stitch-up\" and a \"betrayal\" - and promise to oppose it in Parliament. The Observer agrees that the plan looks \"doomed\" and speak of both party leaders facing \"mounting revolts from their own MPs and activists\", with 104 opposition members said to have written to them to demand a guarantee that any deal would be subject to a confirmatory referendum. Writing in the Sun On Sunday, the former Brexit Secretary, David Davis, cautions the prime minister against making a \"pact with the devil\" to \"simply to wish the problem of Brexit away\". He warns that failing to respect the Brexit vote, following the \"clear message\" sent by the local election results, would be \"suicidal\" for the Conservatives. The chairman of the Tory backbench 1922 Committee, Graham Brady, is equally concerned in the Sunday Telegraph: \"The temptation to do whatever is necessary to secure some kind of Brexit agreement...must be resisted\" he argues. He adds: \"The price could be a catastrophic split in the Conservative party.\" The former Defence Secretary, Gavin Williamson, hits back in the Sunday Express following his sacking over claims he leaked top-secret information. He tells the paper that suggestions he revealed details of the government\\'s future dealings with the Chinese tech giant Huawei were part of a \"slapdash witch-hunt\" triggered by \"political score settling\". He insists he\\'s \"getting hanged for something\" he didn\\'t do, saying he would have welcomed a criminal investigation to clear his name. The Independent online reports that head teachers are \"being subjected to death threats amid a rise in attacks and aggression from parents and pupils\". It says members of the National Association of Head Teachers have signed a motion urging government action, warning that social media is allowing parents to abuse staff directly. The Venezuelan opposition leader, Juan Guaido, gives an exclusive interview to the Washington Post, acknowledging that he made errors in attempting to stir up a military uprising. He admits that he overestimated the level of support he has among the armed forces. Mr Guaido says he would consider any offer of US help, but that any military support would have to be alongside Venezuelan forces opposed to President Maduro.

The Scottish Conservative leader admitted that the Tories and Labour had been given an \"almighty kicking\" in English local elections. But she predicted that they will be given an even bigger \"wake-up call\" in the European election on 23 May. She urged the two parties to find a compromise so the UK can \"move on\". Her speech to the conference was her first major public appearance since the birth of her son Finn in October. The Conservatives lost more than 1,300 seats in the council election and Labour lost 82 as the Liberal Democrats, Greens and independents surged across England. The two major UK parties have been locked in talks aimed at finding a way forward on Brexit for the past month, but it is not clear how much progress has been made. Speaking at the Scottish Conservative conference in Aberdeen, Ms Davidson said the solution lay in finding a compromise that respects the result of the EU referendum. She told delegates: \"The solution doesn\\'t lie in the trenches of one extreme or another - of overturning the referendum, or of crashing out with no deal. \"It lies in those colleagues currently round the table, taking the difficult first steps towards each other. \"So I say to the negotiating teams of our party and the Labour Party, who are currently locked in talks - get Brexit sorted, get a deal over the line and let Britain move on.\" Ms Davidson added: \"If we thought yesterday\\'s results were a wake up call, just wait for the European elections on 23 May. \"A vote the public was promised would never take place, to elect people to a parliament they were told we would already have left.  You don\\'t have to be John Curtice to foresee what could happen.\" Ms Davidson was a staunch Remainer ahead of the referendum, but argued it would be undemocratic hold another vote on EU membership. She said that if a decision was so big that it had to be handed to the people to decide, then \"we have to listen to the answer they give\" and politicians \"don\\'t get to pick and choose\" which votes are upheld and are ignored. Scotland\\'s First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has said she wants to hold a second independence referendum in the next two years if the UK leaves the EU. But Ms Davidson argued that the country is not being held back as part of the UK, and is already capable of \"taking on the world\". She also accused the SNP of using the constitution as an excuse for inaction, and pledged to \"build a better Scotland now\" if her party wins the next Holyrood election. She told delegates that the country has had enough of the SNP\\'s \"agitating for independence\" as she accused the party of \"searching the horizon for a dark cloud and then blaming it on Westminster\". Ms Davidson added: \"I have a more positive view of Scotland\\'s future. I reject their mantra that says we have to have a break-up before we can possibly hope to prosper. I don\\'t see Scotland as subjugated, put upon or as held back. \"Our message is that we can prosper now. That we can back our businesses, build up our institutions and give future generations the skills to take on all comers. \"That right here, right now, Scotland can take on the world. There\\'s nothing stopping us.\" Ms Sturgeon\\'s SNP won 63 seats in the last Scottish Parliament election and the Conservatives won 31 - with opinion polls suggesting the SNP continues to hold a commanding lead ahead of the next vote in 2021. But Ms Davidson insisted it is realistic for her party to win the election and form the next Scottish government. She said: \"As first minister, I won\\'t use every engagement with the UK government as a chance to sow division. I\\'ll use it as a chance to deliver better government for the people who live here. \"And I\\'ll make a firm guarantee now: If I am elected Scotland\\'s next first minister, there will be no more constitutional games and no more referenda. We\\'ve had enough to last a lifetime. \"So we\\'re not fighting each other - but fighting for each other.\" Ms Davidson was overheard questioning whether she needed to mention the European elections as she rehearsed her speech in the conference hall on Friday evening. The rehearsal was apparently caught on a live microphone without Ms Davidson realising, and has since appeared online. Ms Davidson joked in her conference speech that the recording was made after she told her baby son that \"this is the button that broadcasts mummy\\'s rehearsal to the whole press room\". The conference heard from Prime Minister Theresa May on Friday, who told delegates that she remained determined to deliver a Brexit deal despite facing fresh calls to quit.'}, {'date': '2019-05-03', 'title': \"Theresa May: 'Voters want Brexit to be resolved'\", 'content': 'The prime minister has said voters want the Brexit issue resolved so the country can \"move on\". Theresa May was speaking at the Scottish Conservative conference as she faced renewed calls to quit. The deadlock over her Brexit deal has been blamed for the Conservatives losing more than 1,000 seats in English council elections. But Mrs May insisted that she remains determined to deliver a deal that will ensure the UK has a \"bright future\". The backlash against the two main Westminster parties over the Brexit deadlock has also seen Labour lose more 100 seats. But the Liberal Democrats and Greens, who both back another referendum on Brexit, have made big gains. Talks between the Conservatives and Labour aimed at finding a way forward on Brexit started a month ago and are ongoing - although it is not clear how much progress has been made, and both parties remain deeply divided over the best way forward. Some Conservative councillors have openly blamed Mrs May for their election - with one council leader who lost his majority calling on her to \"consider her position\". In her conference speech, Mrs May told delegates that all 13 Scottish Conservative MPs had backed her Brexit deal when parliament voted on it in March. She added: \"If others had followed-suit, we would be leaving the EU on 22 May. But they did not, and we have had to face up to that fact. \"We have had to reach out to the official opposition to secure cross-party support for a deal. That work continues with one clear aim - to get a deal over the line in parliament. \"Across the UK, people want to see the issue of Brexit resolved and for our country to move forward. That is our goal and it is one we are determined to deliver.\" Mrs May also said politicians calling for \"re-runs\" of the Brexit or independence referendums should instead \"accept the decision of the people\". She went on to claim that this \"old fashioned belief\" was a major difference between her and Scotland\\'s first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, who wants to hold a second independence referendum in the next two years. The UK government has already ruled out granting the consent that Ms Sturgeon says would be needed to ensure a referendum was legal. Mrs May said Ms Sturgeon wants to \"re-run the independence referendum because she did not like the decision of the people of Scotland\" and to \"re-run the EU referendum because she did not like the decision of the people of the UK\". The prime minister added: \"She saw Brexit as an opportunity to further her party\\'s obsession with one thing and one thing only - independence. \"Just imagine if Scotland had a government that put as much energy into improving Scotland\\'s hospitals as the SNP put into chasing independence. \"A government as focused on boosting Scotland\\'s economy as the SNP is on internal debates about the hypothetical currency of an independent Scotland. \"Or a first minister who actually lived up to her promises to restore Scotland\\'s education system, instead of letting its standing slip in the international rankings.\" Mrs May also used her speech to announce that the UK government was backing plans to create an underwater engineering base in Aberdeen to boost the oil and gas industries. It is hoped the creation of the underwater hub will build on Scotland\\'s expertise in subsea robotics, remotely-operated vessels and help the oil and gas sector diversify away from fossil fuels. The two-day conference will hear from Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson on Saturday in what will be her first speech since returning from maternity leave after the birth of her son in October. The Scottish Tories have got themselves in a corner. They are now a Brexit supporting party in an overwhelmingly Remain country, which already narrows appeal. But they also can’t even claim to have delivered Brexit. Not much principle or strategic nous on display. https://t.co/OHMU3yj9jA End of Twitter post  by @NicolaSturgeon Speaking ahead of the conference, Ms Davidson insisted that Mrs May was not to blame for the Brexit deadlock as she had done her job by negotiating a deal with the other 27 EU members. She added: \"I think even her harshest critics would have accepted that Prime Minister May has worked exceptionally hard with an almost impossible job. \"There is competing views on what Brexit means within all of the political parties out there, so it\\'s not just a Tory issue, although I\\'m not covering over the cracks and there are definitely different views within the Conservatives. \"I think the frustration for voters is they\\'ve seen vote after vote after vote in the House of Commons, all of which showing what there isn\\'t a majority for, but none of which is showing what there is a majority for. \"And the frustration is they see the voices that are getting louder are the ones at the edges.\" Ms Davidson, who backed Remain ahead of the EU referendum, said she hoped the local government elections would \"really focus minds\" among the negotiating teams so they could reach an agreement that could get through the House of Commons. But she said another referendum on Brexit would not be helpful to the current political situation - and could instead inflame it further. Ms Davidson has been tipped as a future leader of the UK Conservative Party, but has previously ruled out ever taking on the job - saying that her ambition is instead to replace Nicola Sturgeon as first minister of Scotland. And she said she would not be using her first day back from maternity leave to \"lay down the law\" on where Mrs May should give ground in the Brexit talks.'}, {'date': '2019-05-03', 'title': \"Election results: Labour's worst result 'down to Brexit'\", 'content': 'Barnsley\\'s Labour leader said the council election results were the party\\'s worst result for 15 years. Sir Steve Houghton blamed the national failure to carry Brexit through for his party\\'s performance - Labour lost seven seats, but retained control. The Liberal Democrats, who gained three seats to become the main opposition party on the council, put their success down to Labour \"arrogance\". Independent candidates also faired well, gaining five seats. In Sheffield, Labour retained control of the council but lost three seats with gains by both the Liberal Democrats and the Green Party. Nationally both the Conservatives and Labour have been losing seats as voters punished them over Brexit. Sir Steve said the message in Barnsley was \"loud and clear\" that voters were unhappy that Brexit had not been carried through. \"It is a very bad night, the worst we have had for 15 years,\" he said He said Barnsley voted 69% in favour of leaving the European Union and voters \"expect Parliament to deliver but it looks like Labour is blocking it.\" He said the areas were the Liberal Democrats won were not Brexit \"strongholds,\" but areas where local issues had allowed opponents to gain ground. The Liberal Democrats accused Labour of \"arrogance\" in failing to take account of residents\\' views over local housing and transport issues. Lord Scriven, a Liberal Democrat peer and former leader of Sheffield City Council, was at the Barnsley vote count. He said: \"This shows right in the Labour heartlands, when they are arrogant and take people for granted we can win seats.\" Either search using your postcode or council name or click around the map to show local results.

His decision comes as Labour lost seats in Thursday\\'s local elections, with voters turning to smaller parties and independents. Announcing his move on Twitter, Sir Tony said it was partly down to the party\\'s \"continued duplicity on Brexit\". He has previously written a tweet to deputy leader Tom Watson, saying: \"Our party members are overwhelmingly in favour of a second referendum. To campaign on a platform of constructive ambiguity would be unprincipled, duplicitous and rather sinister.\" Labour has refused to fully endorse a further referendum on Brexit - as supported by many ordinary members - instead saying it would do so under certain circumstances. Sir Tony, who has frequently criticised Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn on Twitter, also raised the issue of anti-Semitism and swore when describing the leadership in his tweet.

His association with Tommy Robinson, a former leader of the English Defence League who is known for anti-Islamic views, has been criticised by Nigel Farage and others. Mr Hicks denied the party was becoming far-right and defended Mr Robinson, who is standing as an independent in the North West where 11 parties and independents are standing. He said Mr Robinson was \"certainly a rough diamond and certainly not perfect\". \"But at the end of the day he has stood for certain things that need to be brought to the fore,\" he added.

Ending the contracts with Brittany Ferries and DFDS could cost the taxpayer more than £50m. The government bought £89m worth of capacity from the two firms. Some of that capacity might be sold, but millions of pounds could be lost. The contracts were designed to ease pressure on the port of Dover, by creating extra services at other ports. In February, the DfT was forced to axe its £13.8m contract with a third company, Seaborne Freight, which the BBC found had never sailed a vessel. Earlier this year, the National Audit Office estimated that the cancellation costs of all the ferry contracts would be £56.6m. The cost is likely to only be several million pounds less than this. A government spokesperson said: \"The termination of these contracts has resulted in less cost to the taxpayer than the termination costs reported by the NAO.\" The government was also forced to pay £33m to Eurotunnel, to settle a case which challenged the procurement process for the ferry contracts. In addition, the DfT is now facing legal action from P&O Ferries, which says its rival, Eurotunnel, was given a competitive advantage by the government. Mr Grayling, the Transport Secretary, said the cancelled contracts were part of a £4bn no-deal \"insurance policy\" the government had put in place. \"People would expect a responsible government to take out an insurance policy, and that\\'s what we\\'ve done, to make sure we can deal with all the challenges in a no-deal Brexit. \"We never wanted it, we never worked for it, but we sure as certain needed to be ready for it,\" he said. If extra cross-Channel freight services are needed again in the run-up to the new Brexit deadline in October, the government could have to negotiate a new set of contracts, he said. Labour shadow transport secretary Andy McDonald said the contracts will be \"a case study in ministerial incompetence\" on the part of Mr Grayling. \"The Transport Secretary\\'s approach to procurement and planning has cost taxpayers tens, if not, hundreds of millions of pounds.

It is also advocating for some decision-making powers currently held by Stormont to be transferred to Northern Ireland\\'s 11 councils. Mr Girvan said the absence of devolved government at Stormont means voters are being failed, and that giving more powers to councillors would create a greater deal of political accountability. \"In the vacuum and democratic deficit of the past two years, we feel this not only returns decision-making to a local level, but also offers the representation to people that they have been denied,\" he added.

Further reading: The rise of the word Brexit A referendum - a vote in which everyone (or nearly everyone) of voting age can take part - was held on Thursday 23 June, 2016, to decide whether the UK should leave or remain in the European Union. Leave won by 51.9% to 48.1%. The referendum turnout was 71.8%, with more than 30 million people voting. Get the results in full. England voted for Brexit, by 53.4% to 46.6%.

The European Union - often known as the EU - is an economic and political partnership involving 28 European countries (click here if you want to see the full list). It began after World War Two to foster economic co-operation, with the idea that countries which trade together were more likely to avoid going to war with each other. It has since grown to become a \"single market\" allowing goods and people to move around, basically as if the member states were one country. It has its own currency, the euro, which is used by 19 of the member countries, its own parliament and it now sets rules in a wide range of areas - including on the environment, transport, consumer rights and even things such as mobile phone charges. Click here for a beginners\\' guide to how the EU works. The UK had been due to leave on 29 March 2019, two years after it started the exit process by invoking Article 50 of the EU\\'s Lisbon Treaty. But the withdrawal agreement reached between the EU and UK has been rejected three times by UK MPs. Having granted an initial extension of the Article 50 process until 12 April 2019, EU leaders have now backed a six-month extension until 31 October 2019. However, the UK will leave before this date if the withdrawal agreement is ratified by the UK and the EU before then. As things stand, the UK is due to leave the European Union at 23:00 GMT on 31 October 2019. If the UK and EU ratify the withdrawal agreement before then, the UK will leave on the first day of the following month. Yes. Stopping Brexit would require a change in the law in the UK, something neither the government nor the main UK opposition parties want to do at this point. The European Court of Justice ruled on 10 December 2018 that the UK could cancel the Article 50 Brexit process without the permission of the other 27 EU members, and remain a member of the EU on its existing terms, provided the decision followed a \"democratic process\", in other words, if Parliament voted for it. In March, an online petition calling for Article 50 to be revoked gained over six million signatures. Theresa May has said she wants the UK to leave the EU as soon as possible, if possible by 22 May, so the UK will not have to take part in the European Parliament elections taking place across Europe that month. The EU has said the Brexit process should not be extended again beyond 31 October 2019, but legally speaking another extension could happen if all EU countries, including the UK, agree to it. It would have to be put into law by the government, which has previously ruled it out. But having failed three times to get MPs to support her withdrawal deal, Theresa May has held talks with Jeremy Corbyn about finding a way forward. Some Labour MPs want Mr Corbyn to make a \"confirmatory vote\" on any deal a condition of any agreement. If Labour and the Conservatives fail to reach an agreement, MPs will face a series of votes on Brexit options, which could include another referendum. Mrs May has said her government \"stands ready to abide by the decision of the House\" if Labour does the same.  MPs have twice rejected a \"confirmatory vote\" in Commons votes although the second attempt saw an increased number back it. The main point of having a deal between the UK and the EU is to ensure as smooth as possible an exit from the EU for businesses and individuals - and to allow time for the two sides to hammer out a permanent trading relationship. After months of negotiation, the UK and EU agreed a Brexit deal. It comes in two parts. A 585-page withdrawal agreement. This is a legally-binding text that sets the terms of the UK\\'s divorce from the EU. It covers how much money the UK owes the EU - an estimated £39bn - and what happens to UK citizens living elsewhere in the EU and EU citizens living in the UK. It also proposes a method of avoiding the return of a physical Northern Ireland border. A 26-page statement on future relations. This is not legally-binding and sketches out the kind of long-term relationship the UK and EU want to have in a range of areas, including trade, defence and security. This is part of the withdrawal agreement, which so far, has not been approved by MPs. It refers to a period of time after Brexit until 31 December, 2020 (or possibly later), to get everything in place and allow businesses and others to prepare for the moment when the new post-Brexit rules between the UK and the EU begin. It would also allow more time for the details of the new relationship to be fully hammered out. Free movement would continue during the transition period, as the EU wanted. The UK would be able to strike its own trade deals - although they wouldn\\'t be able to come into force until 1 January 2021. But it all rests on the withdrawal deal being ratified. Yes. This is the so-called no-deal Brexit. The UK would sever all ties with the EU with immediate effect, with no transition period and no guarantees on citizens\\' rights of residence. The government fears this would cause significant disruption to businesses in the short-term, with lengthy tailbacks of lorries at the channel ports, as drivers face new checks on their cargos. Food retailers have warned of shortages of fresh produce and the NHS is stockpiling medicines, in case supplies from EU countries are interrupted. Government ministers and multinational companies with factories in the UK have also warned about the long-term impact on the British economy. Brexit-supporting MPs claim it would not be as bad as they say and the UK would save on the £39bn divorce bill, as well as being free to strike its own beneficial trade deals around the world. Here is a collection of papers published by the government on a \\'no-deal\\' The World Trade Organization sets rules for countries that don\\'t have free trade deals with each other, including tariffs - the taxes charged on the import of goods. Without an agreement on trade, the UK would trade with the EU under World Trade Organization rules. Here is a full explanation of what that would mean. Theresa May\\'s deal cannot come into effect until it has been passed by Parliament. It has now been heavily defeated in two \"meaningful\" votes, and a third vote just on the withdrawal agreement itself, governing the terms of the UK\\'s departure, not the \"future relationship\", a non-binding bit of the deal which maps out aspirations for long-term trade, economic and security cooperation and more. She has told EU leaders that her cross-party talks with Labour are \"based on acceptance of the withdrawal agreement without reopening it\" - with the aim of getting it - and a \"shared vision for the future relationship\", which could be subject to some change, approved by the Commons. So she has not ruled out having another go at getting it ratified - and hopes that reaching out to Labour can help break the deadlock. There is a separate sticking point about whether Speaker John Bercow will allow her to bring the deal back again for another vote. When the UK leaves the EU, the 310-mile border between Ireland and Northern Ireland will become the land border between the UK and the European Union. Neither side wants to see a return to checkpoints, towers, customs posts or surveillance cameras at the border, in case it reignites the Troubles and disrupts the free cross-border flow of trade and people. But they can\\'t agree on a way to do that. The UK and EU agreed to put in place a \"backstop\" - a kind of safety net to ensure there is no hard border whatever the outcome of future trade talks between the UK and the EU. The backstop agreed between the two parties would keep Northern Ireland aligned to some EU rules on things like food products and goods standards. That would prevent the need for checks on goods at the Irish border, but would require some products being brought to Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK to be subject to new checks and controls. The backstop would also involve a temporary single customs territory, effectively keeping the whole of the UK in the EU customs union. If future trade talks broke down without a deal, the backstop would apply indefinitely. The arrangement would end only with the agreement of both the UK and the EU. The backstop was a key sticking point for many MPs who voted down the deal. They feared it could leave Britain tied to the EU indefinitely with no say over its rules and no ability to strike trade deals with other countries. If there were an obvious solution that people agreed guaranteed no return of a hard border in Ireland it would probably have been implemented by now. Possible alternatives suggested include a \"trusted trader\" scheme to avoid physical checks on goods flowing through the border, \"mutual recognition\" of rules with the EU and \"technological\" solutions. However the EU has insisted that the backstop plan is necessary. Theresa May was against Brexit during the referendum campaign but is now in favour of it because she says it is what the British people want. She triggered the two year process of leaving the EU on 29 March, 2017. She set out her negotiating goals in a letter to the EU council president Donald Tusk. She outlined her plans for a transition period after Brexit in a big speech in Florence, Italy. She then set out her thinking on the kind of trading relationship the UK wants with the EU, in a speech in March 2018. Theresa May has been in a precarious position because she lost her House of Commons majority in the 2017 general election. She has survived two attempts to remove her from office so far. The first, in December 2018, was from a group of her own MPs unhappy at her Brexit policy, who organised a no confidence vote in her as Conservative leader. She survived by 200 votes to 117. She is now immune from another attempt to oust her as Tory leader until December 2019. The second was from the Labour Party, who held a no confidence vote in her government after her Brexit plan was voted down in January 2019. All MPs were able to take part in this and she survived by 19 votes. Unlike the internal Tory no confidence vote, there is no limit to the number of times she could face a confidence vote in Parliament and Labour have not ruled out holding further ones. However Mrs May herself has told Tory MPs she will resign, if MPs back her deal, so someone else can lead the next phase of Brexit negotiations, so her time in the top job is limited. Labour says it accepts the referendum result and that Brexit is going to happen. But it opposes Theresa May\\'s Brexit plan, and wants to stop it and force a general election. In February, it said it was prepared to back another referendum to prevent a \"damaging Tory Brexit\", after failing to win a vote of no-confidence against the government. This is the policy the party\\'s governing body has agreed to put in the party\\'s manifesto for May\\'s scheduled elections to the European Parliament. The party leadership has resisted the idea of supporting another referendum in all circumstances - as supported by deputy leader Tom Watson and a number of its MPs. Leader Jeremy Corbyn says he would negotiate a permanent customs union with the EU after Brexit, which would be very similar to the one it has now. This is the only way to keep trade flowing freely and protect jobs, he says, as well as ensuring there is no return to a \"hard border\" in Northern Ireland. He has ruled out staying a member of the single market, as some of his pro-EU MPs want, so he can carry out his plans to nationalise key industries without being hampered by EU competition rules. He says the UK should have a very close relationship with the single market. Labour accepts that some form of free movement of people might have to continue. An agreement between the UK and the EU provides what Theresa May says is certainty to the 3.2 million EU citizens in the UK - as well as citizens of Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland that they will be able to carry on living and working in the UK as they have done with their rights enshrined in UK law and enforced by British courts. UK citizens in the EU will also retain their current rights with what the EU\\'s Jean-Claude Juncker called a cheap and simple administration procedure. The proposal provides a cut-off date of Brexit day - 29 March 2019 - for those to be covered by the rules. Babies born after that date to people who have qualified under these rules will be included in the agreement. Under the plan EU citizens legally resident in the UK and UK citizens in the EU will be able to leave for up to five years before losing the rights they will have as part of the proposed Brexit deal. The UK government is launching an online system to allow EU citizens to apply for settled status on 30 March. The government had originally planned to charge people £65 to use it but that fee has now been dropped and it is free. Anyone who had already paid, when the scheme was being tested, will be reimbursed. Any EU citizen already living and working in the UK will be able to carry on working and living in the UK after Brexit. The current plan is that even after Brexit, people from the EU will be able to move to work in the UK during a \"transition\" phase of about two years. There is also some debate over whether they will have the same rights as those who came before, with possible restrictions on access to benefits or to vote in local elections. The EU wants them to have the same rights as now - the UK doesn\\'t. What exactly happens after the transition period has yet to be decided, but the proposal is for a work permit system along the lines of that for non-EU nationals (see below). Prime Minister Theresa May said one of the main messages she took from the Leave vote was that the British people wanted to see a reduction in immigration. She has insisted the UK government remains committed to reducing annual net migration - the difference between the number of people entering and leaving - to below 100,000. Home Secretary Sajid Javid has declined to commit to this, however. Instead, he has said it will be brought down to \"sustainable\" levels. Mr Javid published the government\\'s long-awaited post-Brexit immigration plans in December. Free movement of people from the EU will effectively continue until the end of the transition period in December 2020. After that, people from the EU will need visas to work in the UK, with priority given to skilled workers - the same system that currently applies to migrants from outside the EU. A consultation is being held on a minimum salary requirement of £30,000 for skilled migrants seeking five-year visas. However, tens of thousands of low-skilled migrants could come to the UK to work for up to a year to protect parts of the economy that rely on overseas labour.  That measure would last until 2025. Visitors from the EU will not need visas. More details here. No. Under the Brexit deal, EU citizens and UK nationals will continue to be able to travel freely with a passport or identity card until the end of the transition period in December 2020. After this period ends, the European Commission has offered visa-free travel for UK nationals coming to the EU for a short stay, as long as the UK offers the same in return. British citizens will, however, have to pay €7 (£6.30) every three years to travel to EU countries, because of a new security system for countries in the passport-free Schengen zone. Yes. It is a British document - there is no such thing as an EU passport, so your passport will stay the same. The government has decided to change the colour to blue for anyone applying for a new or replacement British passport from October 2019. If no trade deal is in prospect by July 2020, the two sides could agree to extend the transition period instead. This would avoid the need for the backstop at that time, and keep trade with the EU flowing as it does now. They could do this only once. The transition could not go on being extended indefinitely. But there is no agreement on how long any extension would be. Some have suggested the end of 2022, but the government position has been for it all to be sorted before the next election, which is due in Spring 2022. Either way, this could keep the UK under EU rules for at least three years after March\\'s official Brexit date, something Brexiteers are also unhappy about. Mrs May has said EU citizens in the UK will be able to stay even if there is no deal done on Brexit. It\\'s worth saying that even if no Brexit deal was done, EU nationals with a right to permanent residence, which is granted after they have lived in the UK for five years, should not see their rights affected after Brexit. There is uncertainty about what no deal would mean for Britons living in France, Spain, Germany and elsewhere. The priority for most will be to register as residents, but the rules - including deadlines for paperwork - vary from country to country. More details here. If the UK leaves without a deal, British citizens who travel to the EU for up to 90 days will not have to apply for a visa - as long as the UK grants reciprocal visa-free travel for all EU citizens in return. The law confirming this arrangement has been adopted by the European Parliament, and now awaits the final sign-off from EU countries. It would come into force whenever the UK leaves the EU, regardless of whether a withdrawal agreement is reached. In the longer term, the EU is planning to launch an electronic application form, called ETIAS (European Travel Information and Authorisation System), for many non-EU countries, including the UK. It would involve paying a fee of €7 (£6.30) every three years. More details here No deal would mean the current reciprocal healthcare, shared by the UK and the EU27, would no longer apply. It could send health insurance premiums soaring for UK citizens who need sufficient cover for holidays or work in the EU. Britons could also find their European Health Insurance Card (EHIC) - a passport to emergency medical treatment - is no longer valid in some EU countries. Read more here All existing EU laws will be copied across into UK law, to prevent legislative \"black holes\", under the terms of the European Union (Withdrawal Bill). The UK government can then decide over a period of time which ones it wants to keep, change or ditch. BBC Europe editor Katya Adler says the UK would have to start from scratch with no rebate, and enter accession talks with the EU. Every member state would have to agree to the UK re-joining. But she says with elections looming elsewhere in Europe, other leaders might not be generous towards any UK demands. New members are required to adopt the euro as their currency, once they meet the relevant criteria, although the UK could try to negotiate an opt-out. According to the latest figures from the Office of National Statistics, net migration to the UK from non-EU countries was 261,000 in the twelve months to September 2018 - the highest since 2004. By contrast, net migration from EU countries was 57,000 - a level last seen in 2009. In other words, the result of the referendum appears to have already had an impact before Brexit has actually happened. There is much debate about the long-term costs and benefits to the UK economy of Brexit - but what we do know for certain is that the EU wants the UK to settle any outstanding bills before it leaves. The £39bn \"divorce bill\" will cover things like pension payments to EU officials, the cost of relocating London-based EU agencies and outstanding EU budget commitments. But the calculation of an exact UK share will depend on exchange rates, on interest rates, on the number of financial commitments that never turn into payments, and more. The UK says that if there is no deal agreed on Brexit it would pay substantially less and focus only on its \"strict international legal obligations\". The UK could leave without any Brexit \"divorce bill\" deal but that would probably mean everyone ending up in court battles. If compromise can be achieved, and if payment of the bill were to be spread over many years, the amounts involved may not be that significant economically. Yes, says BBC Europe editor Katya Adler. There will still be 27 other EU states in the bloc, and others wanting to join in the future, and the common language tends to be English - \"much to France\\'s chagrin\", she says. Probably not, is the answer. It would depend on whether or not the UK decided to get rid of current safety standards. Even if that happened any company wanting to export to the EU would have to comply with its safety rules, and it\\'s hard to imagine a company would want to produce two batches of the same products. If there is a no-deal Brexit, drivers may need a GB sticker if they are travelling to an EU member state, even if their car has a Euro-plate (a number plate displaying both the EU flag and a GB sign). You will not need a GB sticker to drive outside the UK if you replace a Euro-plate with a number plate that features the GB sign without the EU flag, the Department of Transport says. David Cameron, his Chancellor George Osborne and many other senior figures who wanted to stay in the EU predicted an immediate economic crisis if the UK voted to leave and it is true that the pound slumped the day after the referendum - and is currently about 10% down against the dollar, and 10%-15% down against the euro. Predictions of immediate doom were wrong, with the UK economy estimated to have grown 1.8% in 2016, second only to Germany\\'s 1.9% among the world\\'s G7 leading industrialised nations. The UK economy continued to grow at almost the same rate in 2017 but slowed to 1.4% in 2018, the slowest rate since 2012. Inflation rose after June 2016, reaching a five-year high of 3.1% in November 2017. However it has since eased, to stand at 1.8%. Unemployment has continued to fall, to stand at a 43-year year low of 3.9%. Annual house price increases have steadily fallen from 8.2% in June 2016 to 0.6% in the year to February 2019, according to official ONS figures. Read More: How has business been affected by Brexit? People travelling overseas from the UK since the Brexit vote have found their pound buys less. A fall in the pound means exports get a boost as UK goods will be cheaper to buy in other countries, but some imported goods could get more expensive. The UK inflation figure for the year to December 2018 was 2%, above the target level, but not out of kilter with recent years. The average price for property continued to increase after June 2016\\'s EU referendum, although the annual growth rate slowed from 8.2% in the year to June 2016 to 0.6% in the year to February 2019, according to official ONS figures. However, the exact extent to which this is solely due to Brexit is hard to determine. State pensions are set to continue increasing by at least the level of earnings, inflation or 2.5% every year - whichever is the highest, no matter what happens in the Brexit negotiations. There was an early post-referendum cut in interest rates, which has helped keep mortgage and other borrowing rates low. The reasonably strong performance of the UK economy, and the increase in inflation led to the Bank of England raising interest rates from 0.25% to 0.5% in November 2017 - the first increase in interest rates for 10 years - and then to 0.75% in August 2018. Interest rates going up generally makes it more expensive to pay back a mortgage or loan - but should be good news for savers as they should get amore interest on their money. There will be no immediate return of duty-free sales if the UK leaves the EU with a version of Theresa May\\'s deal. That\\'s because existing customs rules will continue to apply for the planned 21-month transition period. The possible return of duty-free could be part of negotiations on a future trade deal after December 2020. If the UK leaves without a deal, duty-free sales could return. The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in Strasbourg is not a European Union institution. It was set up by the Council of Europe, which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine. So quitting the EU will not exempt the UK from its decisions. The Conservatives are committed to sticking with the Human Rights Act which requires UK courts to treat the ECHR as setting legal precedents for the UK during the Brexit process. The Court of Justice of the European Union - to give it its full name - is the EU\\'s highest legal authority. It is based in Luxembourg. It is an entirely different thing to the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR). It is the European Court of Human Rights, not the ECJ that has often upset British politicians by making it harder, for example, to deport terrorist suspects. The ECJ interprets and enforces the rules of the single market, settling disputes between member countries over issues like free movement and trade. It is at the centre of pretty much everything the EU does and it having the power over UK actions has been a key issue for those arguing for the UK to leave to the EU to regain full sovereignty. Prime Minister Theresa May has vowed that Britain will not be under the \"direct\" jurisdiction of the ECJ after Brexit. But she has suggested that elements of relations could - where the UK signs up to specific EU agencies - still be covered by the ECJ after Brexit After that, there will need to be a new mechanism for settling disputes between the UK and the EU but what form that take has yet to be decided. There has been talk of an ombudsman, or some other third party, being appointed to settle disagreements. The version of the Brexit deal, published on 8 December 2017, do also give limited powers to the ECJ in terms of EU citizens living in the UK for up to eight years. The political declaration document makes clear that ECJ will continue to have a role on interpreting EU law after Brexit. Please upgrade your browser These terms are used during debate on the terms of the UK\\'s departure from the EU. There is no strict definition of either, but they are used to refer to the closeness of the UK\\'s relationship with the EU post-Brexit. So at one extreme, \"hard\" Brexit could involve the UK refusing to compromise on issues like the free movement of people even if it meant leaving the single market or having to give up hopes of aspects of free trade arrangements. At the other end of the scale, a \"soft\" Brexit might follow a similar path to Norway, which is a member of the single market and has to accept the free movement of people as a result of that. The single market is seen by its advocates as the EU\\'s biggest achievement and one of the main reasons it was set up in the first place. Britain was a member of a free trade area in Europe before it joined what was then known as the common market. In a free trade area countries can trade with each other without paying tariffs - but it is not a single market because the member states do not have to merge their economies together. The European Union single market, which was completed in 1992, allows the free movement of goods, services, money and people within the European Union, as if it was a single country. It is possible to set up a business or take a job anywhere within it. The idea was to boost trade, create jobs and lower prices. But it requires common law-making to ensure products are made to the same technical standards and imposes other rules to ensure a \"level playing field\". Critics say it generates too many petty regulations and robs members of control over their own affairs. Mass migration from poorer to richer countries has also raised questions about the free movement rule. Read more: A free trade area v EU single market The customs union ensures EU member states all charge the same import duties to countries outside the EU. It allows member states to trade freely with each other, without burdensome customs checks at borders, but it limits their freedom to strike their own trade deals. It is different from a free trade area. In a free trade area no tariffs, taxes or quotas are charged on goods and services moving within the area but members are free to strike their own external trade deals. The government says the UK is leaving the customs union after the transition period but ministers have yet to decide on what will replace it. Article 50 is a plan for any country that wishes to exit the EU to do so. It was created as part of the Treaty of Lisbon - an agreement signed up to by all EU states which became law in 2009. Before that treaty, there was no formal mechanism for a country to leave the EU. It\\'s pretty short - just five paragraphs Britain got a new Prime Minister - Theresa May. The former home secretary took over from David Cameron, who announced he was resigning on the day he lost the referendum. She became PM without facing a full Conservative leadership contest after her key rivals from what had been the Leave side pulled out. Theresa May surprised almost everyone after the 2017 Easter Bank Holiday by calling an election for 8 June (it had not been due until 2020). She said she wanted to strengthen her hand in Brexit negotiations with European leaders. She said Labour, the SNP and other opposition parties - and members of the House of Lords - would try to block and frustrate her strategy. However Mrs May did not increase her party\\'s seats in the Commons and she ended up weakened, having to rely on support from the 10 MPs from Northern Ireland\\'s Democratic Unionist Party.  You can get more detail on the 2017 election here. No nation state has ever left the EU. But Greenland, one of Denmark\\'s overseas territories, held a referendum in 1982, after gaining a greater degree of self government, and voted by 52% to 48% to leave, which it duly did after a period of negotiation. The BBC\\'s Carolyn Quinn visited Greenland to find out how they did it. Scotland\\'s First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said in the wake of the Leave result that it was \"democratically unacceptable\" that Scotland faced being taken out of the EU when it voted to Remain. She has called for an extension of the 21-month transition period to give the UK government more time to negotiate a compromise with opposition parties - and has officially asked for another referendum to be held, on the final Brexit deal. The SNP leader wants to stay in the customs union and single market after Brexit, describing it as the \"least damaging\" option for the UK economy as a whole - and has thrown her weight behind the campaign for another EU referendum. They officially started a year after the referendum, on 19 June, 2017. Here\\'s a picture from that first session: The UK and EU negotiating teams met face-to-face for one week each month, with a few extra sessions also thrown in ahead of EU summits. Their first tasks were trying to get an agreement on the rights of UK and EU expat citizens after Brexit, reaching a figure for the amount of money the UK will need to pay on leaving, the so-called \"divorce bill\", and what happens to the Northern Ireland border. A provisional deal on these issues was reached on 8 December, 2017: \\'Breakthrough\\' deal in Brexit talks. They then agreed terms for the \"transition\" phase and now have moved on to the permanent post-Brexit relationship, while trying to agree on the precise wording of the divorce issues. Theresa May set up a government department, headed by veteran Conservative MP and Leave campaigner David Davis, to take responsibility for Brexit talks. Former defence secretary, Liam Fox, who also campaigned to leave the EU, was given the new job of international trade secretary and Boris Johnson, who was a leader of the official Leave campaign, was foreign secretary. These three were each playing roles in negotiations with the EU. However that has all changed now, with Boris Johnson and David Davis resigning over Theresa May\\'s preferred Brexit plan. Dominic Raab took over as Brexit secretary - but resigned in November - and Jeremy Hunt is foreign secretary. Mrs May has made clear that she is in charge of the negotiations and the new Brexit Secretary Steve Barclay will not be getting heavily involved in the Brussels talks. Senior civil servant Olly Robbins has been the top EU official at the Brexit talks in Brussels. He started out at the top official at the Brexit department but was moved to the Cabinet Office to work directly for Theresa May, as the PM took more control over the process. Who\\'s who guide to both sides\\' negotiators. The UK Independence Party, which received nearly four million votes - 13% of those cast - in the 2015 general election, but who saw their vote collapse to about a quarter of that at this year\\'s election, has campaigned for many years for Britain\\'s exit from the EU. They were joined in their call during the referendum campaign by about half the Conservative Party\\'s MPs, including Boris Johnson and five members of the then Cabinet. A handful of Labour MPs and Northern Ireland party the DUP were also in favour of leaving. They said Britain was being held back by the EU, which they said imposed too many rules on business and charged billions of pounds a year in membership fees for little in return. They also wanted the UK to make all of its own laws again, rather than being created through shared decision making with other EU nations. Immigration was also a big issue for Brexit supporters, They wanted Britain to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people coming here to live and/or work. One of the main principles of EU membership is \"free movement\", which means you don\\'t need to get a visa to go and live in another EU country. The Leave campaign also objected to the idea of \"ever closer union\" between EU member states and what they see as moves towards the creation of a \"United States of Europe\". Then Prime Minister David Cameron was the leading voice in the Remain campaign, after reaching an agreement with other European Union leaders that would have changed the terms of Britain\\'s membership had the country voted to stay in. He said the deal would give Britain \"special\" status and help sort out some of the things British people said they didn\\'t like about the EU, like high levels of immigration - but critics said the deal would make little difference. Sixteen members of Mr Cameron\\'s Cabinet, including the woman who would replace him as PM, Theresa May, also backed staying in. The Conservative Party was split on the issue and officially remained neutral in the campaign. The Labour Party, Scottish National Party, Plaid Cymru, the Green Party and the Liberal Democrats were all in favour of staying in. The then US president Barack Obama also wanted Britain to remain in the EU - unlike his successor, Donald Trump, who is an enthusiastic champion of Brexit - as did the leaders of other EU nations such as France and Germany. Those campaigning for Britain to stay in the EU said it got a big boost from membership - it makes selling things to other EU countries easier and, they argued, the flow of immigrants, most of whom are young and keen to work, fuels economic growth and helps pay for public services. They also said Britain\\'s status in the world would be damaged by leaving and that we are more secure as part of the 28 nation club, rather than going it alone. Big business - with a few exceptions - tended to be in favour of Britain staying in the EU because it makes it easier for them to move money, people and products around the world. Given the crucial role of London as a financial centre, there\\'s interest in how many jobs may be lost to other hubs in the EU. Some UK exporters say they\\'ve had increased orders or enquiries because of the fall in the value of the pound. Others are less optimistic, fearing products for the European market may have to be made at plants in the EU. Here are a selection of questions sent in - you can ask yours via the form at the end of this page The good news for Edward, from Cambridge, who asked this question, is we have been working on exactly such a list. Click here for the latest version. In answer to this query from Nancy from Hornchurch - the UK is one of 10 member states who pay more into the EU budget than they get out. Only France and Germany contribute more. In 2014/15, Poland was the largest beneficiary, followed by Hungary and Greece. The UK also gets an annual rebate that was negotiated by Margaret Thatcher and money back, in the form of regional development grants and payments to farmers, which added up to £4.6bn in 2014/15. According to the latest Treasury figures, the UK\\'s net contribution for 2014/15 was £8.8bn - nearly double what it was in 2009/10. The National Audit Office, using a different formula which takes into account EU money paid directly to private sector companies and universities to fund research, and  measured over the EU\\'s financial year, shows the UK\\'s net contribution for 2014 was £5.7bn. Read more number crunching from Reality Check. Dee, from Launceston, wanted to know what would happen to EU laws covering protected species such as bats in the event of Britain leaving the EU. As already mentioned the plan is for all EU laws to be transferred into UK law as part of the EU (withdrawal) Bill. That means the government then has time to decide what laws to keep, scrap or change without the risk of a legal black hole on the first day after Brexit. The status of Special Areas of Conservation and Special Protection Areas, which are designated by the EU, would be reviewed to see what alternative protections could be applied. The same process would apply to European Protected Species legislation, which relate to bats and their habitats.  The issue has been a hot one and Environment Secretary Michael Gove has insisted that the UK will maintain or enhance its environmental laws. Sophie from Peterborough, who asks the question, need not worry. We have consulted Alasdair Rendall, president of the UK Eurovision fan club, who says: \"All participating countries must be a member of the European Broadcasting Union. The EBU - which is totally independent of the EU - includes countries both inside and outside of the EU, and also includes countries such as Israel that are outside of Europe. Indeed the UK started participating in the Eurovision Song Contest in 1957, 16 years before joining the then EEC.\" The answer to Alan\\'s question, the European Commission says, is that pet passports will, like everything else, depend on whether the UK leaves with a deal or not. The UK introduced the pet passport scheme in 2000, replacing the previous quarantine laws. It means you and your dog, cat or ferret can travel between the UK and the EU (and other participating countries) as long as it has a passport, a microchip and has been vaccinated against rabies. If the UK leaves with a deal, this will not change. If there\\'s no deal, pet passports issued in the UK would not be valid for travel to the EU. Pet owners planning to travel with their animals, would need to get them microchipped and vaccinated against rabies. Further details are on the government website. Ged, from Liverpool, suspects \"red tape\" is a euphemism for employment rights and environmental protection. According to the Open Europe think tank, four of the top five most costly EU regulations are either employment or environment-related. The UK renewable energy strategy, which the think-tank says costs £4.7bn a year, tops the list. The working time directive (£4.2bn a year) - which limits the working week to 48 hours - and the temporary agency workers directive (£2.1bn a year), giving temporary staff many of the same rights as permanent ones - are also on the list. Most of the EU-derived laws on the UK\\'s statute books will be copied across into UK law so that businesses can continue to function on the day Britain leaves the EU, in March 2019. Future governments will then be able to amend or scrap them. Brexit may also generate \"red tape\" of its own - if the UK leaves the single market and the customs union, businesses could face more paperwork as they cross borders into EU countries. Ste, in Bolton, asked about this. The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership  - or TTIP - currently under negotiation between the EU and United States would create the biggest free trade area the world has ever seen. Cheerleaders for TTIP, including former PM David Cameron, believed it could make American imports cheaper and boost British exports to the US to the tune of £10bn a year. But many on the left, including Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, feared it would shift more power to multinational corporations, undermine public services, wreck food standards and threaten basic rights. This debate now appears academic as US President Donald Trump is not a fan of the agreement, which means it has been shelved in its previous form - but whatever happens, when the UK quits the EU it would no longer be part of a revived TTIP and is planning to negotiate its own trade deal with the US. Paddy, from Widnes, wanted to know how leaving the EU will affect the number of doctors we have and impact the NHS. This became an issue in the referendum debate after the Leave campaign claimed the money Britain sends to the EU, which it claimed was £350m a week, could be spent on the NHS instead. The BBC\\'s Reality Check team looked into this claim. Before the vote the then Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt warned that leaving the EU would lead to budget cuts and an exodus of overseas doctors and nurses. The Leave campaign dismissed his intervention as \"scaremongering\" and insisted that EU membership fees could be spent on domestic services like the NHS. Since the referendum there has been a relaxation of the immigration rules for doctors from outside the EU and an increase in the planned number of \"home grown\" doctors qualifying through new medical schools. But according to Personnel Today there were fewer EU nationals moving to work in the NHS, and an increase in the number quitting. Spending on the NHS has continued at the same level as planned before the referendum, although Theresa May said in June 2018 that a \"Brexit dividend\" was helping fund a larger-than-planned £20bn increase in NHS spending in England by 2023. As long as Britain has been in the EU we haven\\'t really talked much about tariffs. That\\'s because all trade within the European Economic Area is tariff-free. On top of that the EU has trade agreements with 52 other countries as well. After Brexit, Britain is going to have to negotiate new deals all on its own. That\\'s both a problem and an opportunity. For example you can use tariffs against foreign imports to protect businesses you care about, as the EU does with agricultural produce, but you do then run the risk of retaliation from your trading partners. The key body in all of this is the World Trade Organisation and at the moment the UK is only a member via its membership of the EU. The UK will automatically become a member in its own right as soon as it leaves the EU. The principle of non-discrimination means that WTO members must not treat any member less advantageously than any other. In practice, this should prevent the EU introducing tariffs on the UK which would discriminate against us, or the UK introducing similar tariffs on the EU. Non-food items imported into the EU currently have a tariff of about 2,3%. Cars have a 10% tariff - but if the EU were to impose a 10% tariff on UK car imports, then the UK could impose the same tariff on German and French cars. The two sides would want to avoid a tit-for-tat trade war. They are hoping to strike a broad agreement on trading terms by December 2020, which would include a \"free trade area and deep co-operation on goods, with zero tariffs and quotas\". The UK will also need to reach agreements with other nations around the world. In reply to Peter - there are basically two views on what will happen in terms of clout when outside the EU. View one is that the UK projects power and influence in the world, working through organisations such as the EU and that on our own it\\'ll be a much diminished force. View two is that unencumbered by the other 27 members, the UK can get on with things and start adopting a much more independent, self-confident, assertive role on the world stage. Veronique, who lives in Italy asked this one.  After Brexit, there will be two possibilities. If the UK leaves the EU without a deal, the situation will depend on the individual country where you live. For the Bradleys in Italy, for example, residents from non-EU countries, and that will soon include the Brits, will have to finalise their residency status, acquire an Italian identity card and then apply for an Italian health insurance card. If they visit the UK at the moment, access to the NHS for non-resident Brits is not straightforward unless you have a European health insurance card. The right to treatment is based on residency, not on your tax status. So, even if you live abroad and pay some British tax on a buy-to-let property for instance, you might find yourself getting a bill for any NHS treatment you end up getting while you are back in the UK. Peter, a German citizen living in the UK asked this question, and the good news is that if you are an EU national and you get a British state pension, nothing much should change, because the state pension is dependent not on where you come from, but on how long you have paid National Insurance contributions in the UK. So it doesn\\'t matter whether you come from Lithuania or Latvia or Transylvania or Timbuktu, what counts is how much you have paid in terms of National Insurance contributions. There is one wrinkle though and that is that you have to have paid in for at least 10 years. Under the current rules, if you are an EU citizen and haven\\'t paid in for 10 years, you can point to any contributions you have made in your native country and say, \"I paid in there\", and that will count. That works for EU countries and another 16 countries with which the UK has social security agreements. Once we have left the EU, you will no longer be able to do that unless we negotiate new reciprocal agreements. If we don\\'t then potentially, if you have paid in fewer than than 10 years\\' worth of National Insurance contributions, you will not get a British state pension. Anyone born in Northern Ireland has an absolute right to carry both passports. Declan, an Irish passport holder, might be happy to know that this is one of the few questions where I can\\'t see a downside as long as you are happy and comfortable carrying both passports. The Irish document means you continue to enjoy the benefits of EU citizenship, and the British passport will give you full rights in the UK at the same time. Call it one of the clear joys of coming from Northern Ireland, alongside the rolling hills, rugged coastline and enjoyable breaks between the showers. All you have to do is remember to carry the Irish passport when you are joining the EU citizens-only queue at the airport in future. Send us your Brexit questions using the form below.

Terms and conditions The BBC\\'s Privacy Policy'}, {'date': '2019-04-30', 'title': 'Brexit: Labour supports a referendum with caveats', 'content': 'Labour\\'s governing body has agreed to support a further referendum on Brexit under certain circumstances. The National Executive Committee met to decide the wording of its manifesto for May\\'s European elections. It rejected the idea of campaigning for a referendum under all circumstances - as supported by deputy leader Tom Watson and many ordinary members. But the party will demand a public vote if it cannot get changes to the government\\'s deal or an election. The National Executive Committee (NEC) oversees the overall direction of the party and is made up of representatives including shadow cabinet members, MPs, councillors and trade unions. A Labour source said: \"The NEC agreed the manifesto which will be fully in line with Labour\\'s existing policy to support Labour\\'s alternative plan and if we can\\'t get the necessary changes to the government\\'s deal, or a general election, to back the option of a public vote.\" The decision was sufficiently nuanced, though, that MPs have interpreted it in different ways. Wes Streeting, who favours another referendum, tweeted that the NEC had \"made the right call and confirmed that a public vote will be in our manifesto for the European elections\". Fellow pro-referendum MP Bridget Phillipson said Labour had \"done the bare minimum needed\" and she could \"only hope\" it would be enough to win over voters who want another say on Brexit. On the other side of the party, Gloria De Piero, who is against another vote, also welcomed the decision, arguing it meant the manifesto would \"not contain a pledge\" to hold a referendum - only keeping it as \"an option\" if a general election could not be engineered. The UK will have to take part in European Parliamentary elections on 23 May unless a Brexit deal is accepted by MPs before then. Labour agreed a policy at its last conference that if Parliament voted down the government\\'s withdrawal deal with the EU - which it has effectively done three times - or talks ended in no-deal, there should be a general election. But if it could not force one, conference agreed that the party \"must support all options remaining on the table, including campaigning for a public vote\". Since then, though, Labour has entered into cross-party talks with the Conservatives to see if they can reach a consensus on how to get a Brexit deal through Parliament so that Britain can leave. Many Labour members wanted the party to make its agreement to any deal conditional on it being put to a public vote - what Labour calls a \"confirmatory ballot\". Labour have not yet made clear what their proposed referendum would be on, but a party briefing paper to MPs published earlier this year said it would need to have \"a credible Leave option and Remain\" on the ballot paper. On the surface it doesn\\'t look like Labour\\'s position has changed - but it has a little bit. Tom Watson, along with some trade unions and some party members, wanted a full-throated commitment to a referendum under all circumstances. What they have ended up with instead is a compromise or a fudge. Labour will call for a referendum if the Conservatives don\\'t make changes to their Brexit deal. Some pro-referendum MPs aren\\'t too disappointed because they believe the Conservatives won\\'t move far enough and that leaves the door open to a referendum in the end anyway. Others, though, are disappointed because they think this is a way of avoiding a clear commitment in the run-up to the European elections. In truth, it puts the ball back into the Tories\\' court when it comes to those cross-party Brexit talks. Jeremy Corbyn is saying to Theresa May \"if you can compromise with us, we can hold back the tide of demands in our own party for a referendum.\" That\\'s the bargain he\\'s offering. Speaking ahead of the NEC\\'s decision, Tom Watson, the party\\'s deputy leader, said \"the context has changed\" since the 2018 party conference and Labour should now throw its full support behind a second referendum \"to heal the divide in the country\". Afterwards, he described the party\\'s agreed manifesto as \"very good\" and insisted he was not \"disappointed\" with the outcome - although he said would say more when the document was published next week.

Colin Parry, whose son Tim died in the 1993 bombing, said she \"should disavow these comments if that\\'s her position\". A Brexit Party spokesman said Ms Fox \"does not hold those views now\". Tim Parry, 12, and Johnathan Ball, three, were killed in the IRA bombing on March 20, 1993, which left 56 others injured. The RCP defended \"the right of the Irish people to take whatever measures necessary in their struggle for freedom\" in the party\\'s newsletter published shortly after the killings. Mr Parry, who set up the Tim Parry Johnathan Ball Peace Foundation with his wife Wendy to provide conflict resolution and victim support, said Ms Fox should explain her position. He added: \"For somebody to come out with comments I believe she made, and being an apologist for the IRA, is absolutely disgraceful. \"If this woman would care to explain her comments back at that time to me and my wife, I would like her to do so.\" Ms Fox is the number one candidate in the north west of England for Nigel Farage\\'s Brexit Party, and if the polls are correct, likely to become Warrington\\'s MEP.

He added: \"It\\'s a desperate attempt to cause trouble. That was 20 years ago and she is committed to democracy and peaceful solutions.\" Ms Fox said in a statement she felt the \"greatest sympathy\" for the Parry family for the \"tragic\" loss of their son and it \"must have been terribly painful, as for all victims of violence during the Troubles\".

She told MPs there was no reason the UK could not leave in a matter of weeks once MPs backed an agreement, which they have so far rejected three times. She signalled she hoped to get Labour backing for any new customs proposal before putting it to Parliament again. She said their aims were \"very similar\" and \"sometimes people use different terms to mean the same thing\". Labour wants the PM to sign up to the idea of a customs union with the EU, something she has adamantly opposed up to now, and some have suggested she is moving in their direction. Most Conservative MPs have said they would not support the move, saying it would mean the UK would not have an independent trade policy. Mrs May chose to open talks with Jeremy Corbyn after Parliament rejected the withdrawal agreement she has negotiated with the EU a third time late last month. After this defeat, the EU extended the deadline for the UK\\'s departure - originally set for 29 March - until 31 October. Mrs May told MPs she hoped the extension would be \"terminable\" well before this date and the UK would find itself outside the EU \"as soon as possible\". Appearing before the Liaison Committee of senior MPs, she said the choice facing Parliament was the same as when it last rejected her agreement. MPs could opt to agree a deal and leave in an orderly fashion, to leave without a deal, hold another referendum, or to stay in the EU by revoking Article 50 - only the first of which she found \"acceptable\". She said she was \"convinced\" that reaching out to Labour to try and build a majority for any deal was the right thing to do. If no agreement was reached, she said the government would stand by its commitment to give MPs the chance to vote on a series of options, with ministers abiding by the outcome. Pressed by Labour MP Hilary Benn on whether this would include a customs union, Mrs May pointed out that Parliament had already rejected the idea on more than one occasion. But she added: \"Various terms are used in relation to customs. Sometimes people use different terms to mean the same thing, sometimes it is meaning different approaches. \"But what I think is important when we comes to that process is that anything we put before the House, I hope would would be able to get agreement with the opposition so there is a process that everyone can stand behind.\" Asked whether she was prepared to soften her opposition to a customs union, she said both sides needs to \"identify\" what they were trying to achieve. On the issue of post-Brexit trade, she said the government and Labour had \"very similar\" objectives, which were to protect jobs and to ensure as frictionless as trade as possible. But Labour MP Yvette Cooper said MPs felt \"they were going around in circles and paralysed like nothing is changing\". Conservative MP Bernard Jenkin, who voted against the deal three times, said the PM had been under no obligation to agree the terms of the extension offered by the EU. In response, she told him that if all Conservatives had voted to leave the EU the UK would no longer be a member. While the UK\\'s policy was to leave with a deal, she insisted this was \"not entirely in the hands of the UK government\" as it would be up to the EU to decide on any further extension.'}, {'date': '2019-04-30', 'title': \"Labour's NEC Brexit meeting: What is at stake?\", 'content': 'After a meeting of the shadow cabinet and of the party\\'s National Executive Committee, Labour\\'s policy this evening may turn out to be exactly, or almost exactly, the same as it was this morning. But don\\'t assume today\\'s deliberations aren\\'t significant. Allies of Jeremy Corbyn interpret Labour\\'s current policy policy - agreed at the 2018 conference - to mean the party would keep open the option of a \"public vote\" (i.e. a referendum) to avoid \"a bad Tory deal\" or \"no deal\". But Labour\\'s deputy leader Tom Watson is campaigning for a vote on any deal - including one that Jeremy Corbyn might negotiate. An ally of the party leader on the NEC, Claudia Webbe, has denounced Tom Watson as \"divisive\". But, in truth, he is merely highlighting the divisions which are already there. Some Labour MPs in Leave-supporting areas want no mention of a second referendum - a view shared by some of the leader\\'s shadow cabinet allies. Others can live with the current formulation of a heavily caveated commitment to a referendum as a last resort. But the need to fight European elections - taking place on 23 May - has led 34 of the party\\'s candidates to say that this ambiguity is no longer sustainable. Around 100 MPs from across the party agree with them. They want a clear commitment to a referendum under all circumstances. For opponents of Jeremy Corbyn there is a bonus too. Polling suggests an overwhelming number of party members back a referendum and want to remain. If Mr Corbyn stands in the way of this, the hope is that some of the newer members on the left will become disillusioned with his leadership. And that hope for his opponents is a fear for some of his backers. Groups such as Love Socialism, Hate Brexit have as their driving force members of the left-wing group Momentum. They believe the project of enthusing younger left-wing voters will stall unless the leadership shifts position on a referendum. From Tom Watson\\'s perspective, even if he loses the argument at the left-dominated NEC, he will have been seen as a champion of the party\\'s grassroots and will have gained the support of some significant trade unions. Some of Jeremy Corbyn\\'s allies, meanwhile, are keen to defeat the position favoured by the party\\'s deputy not just to put him in his box. They believe that defeating a call for a referendum on any deal would allow them to reach agreement with the government in the current Brexit talks. If they can get commitments to workers\\' rights and something that looks like a customs union, then this would no longer be deemed a \"bad Tory Brexit\" and there would be no need to have a second referendum - which they feel could alienate working class Leave voters. It would also get Brexit settled before the party conference season (and the October deadline set by the EU) and allow the party to relaunch on a platform of \"healing divisions\". There would, of course, be a big rebellion in Labour\\'s ranks but as no option at this stage is a good option, then this might be seen as a price worth paying. Or it might provoke a challenge to the Corbyn leadership. But the last time the party leader was challenged - for what was seen as his lacklustre support for Remain in the 2016 referendum - his supporters rallied round and his opponent, pro-EU Owen Smith, was defeated. So although there may be a wedge between Jeremy Corbyn and some of his left-wing supporters on Europe right now, they may return to his fold if they believe his leadership is seriously in danger. So far though, Brexit has had a range of unintended political consequences so don\\'t rule out the possibility of further dramatic developments.'}, {'date': '2019-04-30', 'title': 'EU elections: Farage launches Brexit Party campaign in Wales', 'content': 'The main UK political parties have \"wilfully decided to go against\" the 2016 EU referendum result, Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage has said.

Mr Gill, elected as a UKIP MEP in 2014, said: \"People are angry, people need to know what they can do. \"And we\\'re saying to them, you can have another vote. \"You can go to the ballot box and you can reiterate that message that you gave in 2016 that you just want to leave the EU.\" UKIP came a close second to Labour at the last European elections in Wales in 2014. Mr Gill then led the party into elections in the Welsh Assembly, but after party rows left UKIP in the assembly and then the assembly itself. He quit UKIP last year, following Mr Farage\\'s decision to leave the organisation. \"We have none of the past problems that UKIP had,\" Mr Gill, who leads the Brexit Party list for Wales, said. \"We are just about making sure that Brexit is delivered, and that\\'s what people voted for, that\\'s what they wanted, that\\'s what they expected. \"That\\'s what we all thought was going to happen on the 29th of March, and here we are, three years after we voted to leave, and we\\'re being asked to vote in the European election - it\\'s unbelievable.\" There are eight parties fighting for four seats in the planned European elections in May.

He said there would be further meetings between the parties this week. Labour\\'s shadow environment secretary Sue Hayman said there had been \"really constructive discussion\" on Monday. She said the two parties were \"getting much more into the nuts and bolts of the detail\", and that she believed the government was \"open to moving forward in our direction\".

Monday\\'s talks were led on the government side by Chancellor Philip Hammond, Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay and Environment Secretary Michael Gove. The Labour team included shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer, shadow chancellor John McDonnell and Ms Hayman.

Ms Hayman confirmed that a \"public vote\" on Brexit had been on the agenda for all of their meetings and Labour was \"exploring ways in which we can work with the government on this\".

But the PM\\'s de facto deputy David Lidington said on Monday that the latest round of talks had been \"productive\", while Labour described them as \"constructive\". All EU members - including the UK at present - are inside the customs union, meaning they do not have to pay taxes, called tariffs, to move goods and services between them. This keeps cost down and avoids delays, but members have to operate as part of a bloc and cannot do their own trade deals with other countries around the world. Labour is arguing for the UK to be part of a new form of customs union arrangement where the country could have \"a say\" in policy despite no longer being in the EU. Critics say the EU would never agree to that, and in any case, the purpose of Brexit is to break free and remaining in a customs arrangement would go against that. Leaving the customs union was also a Conservative manifesto commitment at the 2017 general election. Mr Hunt told BBC Radio 4\\'s Today programme: \"If we were proposing - which I very much hope we don\\'t - to sign up to the customs union, then I think there is a risk you would lose more Conservative MPs than you would gain Labour MPs.\" However, he said he \"definitely\" thought the government could secure a deal that MPs would back. Other cabinet ministers - including International Trade Secretary Liam Fox - have also recently signalled their unease at a customs union agreement. Shadow chancellor John McDonnell tweeted that Mr Hunt\\'s comment did \"not inspire confidence that if a deal is agreed it would be successfully entrenched and last any longer than the next Tory leadership election\".

After meeting Mr Costa, and the British in Europe and The Three Million campaign groups, Brexit Secretary Steve Barclay said he would reply to Mr Barnier for assurances on rights provided to EU citizens in the UK to be reciprocated. But Mr Costa said he would again push the PM to write directly to Mr Tusk, calling for the inclusion of other EU state leaders in the discussions.

In Londonderry, many clubs play on an all-Ireland basis, with teams travelling to Cork, Dublin or Galway in the hopes of claiming silverware. But what impact will Brexit have on cross-border sport? Peter McCartney, general manager of the North West Cricket Union, believes that it is a concern for many organisers. \"At the moment, players can travel with no problems at all, so anything that will impact the freedom of the players to move between different clubs and leagues, we\\'re quite wary of any impact on that,\" he said. \"It\\'s not just a cricket issue, it\\'s golf, rugby, triathlon, horse racing, sport\\'s very much an all-island system and, given the size of the economy it generates, we definitely would see it as high priority.\" Cricket is well established in the north west, with local clubs regularly producing players who go on to represent Ireland internationally. But compared to others, the pre-planning they can do can be hampered by a lack of funding. \"The national governing body, Cricket Ireland, is looking into it, but we\\'re not on the same scale as the larger sporting bodies so we can\\'t look at it in the same level of detail,\" said Mr McCartney. \"Our NW Warrior team play in All-Ireland competitions in Dublin, Belfast, Cork, and then in a few weeks they\\'ll be in La Manga in Spain, so we have been taking a few practical steps checking visa applications, making sure all passports are up to date, just to make sure there will be no issues coming through.\" But should sport be higher up the list when it comes to post-Brexit planning? \"Definitely,\" said Mr McCartney. \"I can understand from the government\\'s point of view that they\\'re looking at the higher impact, the movement of people, tariffs etc, but certainly the knock-on effect for sport, leisure, well-being, I would think these things should be key.\" At the Ryan McBride Brandywell Stadium, Friday is match night, and with a match to win, thoughts of Brexit are far from many supporters\\' minds. Derry City is the only team from Northern Ireland to play in the League of Ireland, a competition that sees players and fans travel across Ireland to compete in the \"greatest league in the world\". The club\\'s director, Andrew Cassidy, believes fans will continue to travel to both home and away fixtures, regardless of the outcome of Brexit. For Mr Cassidy, the \"best case scenario\" would be for nothing to change in terms of the border. \"It\\'s the same as any other business in the town that has cross-border workers or premises, the fact of the matter is, we just don\\'t know,\" he said. \"It could affect things like signing players from the south, if there\\'s any impact on them moving to Derry, or vice versa, but any delays at the border are the only thing that will worry fans at this point.\" From its home close to the border, City of Derry RFC has forged close ties with rugby clubs in Donegal, even attracting star players from the neighbouring county. Made up of youth, women\\'s and senior men\\'s teams, players and coaches travel every weekend to play matches in both the Ulster and All-Ireland leagues. PRO Michael O\\'Kane\\'s main concern is player welfare. \"If we are playing in Letterkenny (in County Donegal) or Galway, is our health insurance going to be catered for,\" he asked. \"At the minute, under EU regulations, we enjoy the back-up of knowing that if an injury does happen then we are covered, so if players are travelling do we need extra insurance?\" Like many sports clubs, volunteers are at the heart of City of Derry RFC and Michael O\\'Kane fears that changes or additional paperwork could lead to an \"administrative headache\" for clubs. \"Everybody has concerns because of the unknown, we really don\\'t know what lies ahead in terms of legislation and regulations,\" he said. \"There is a lot of integration within the sporting community. Here in the North West the border is invisible, both physically and mentally. We have players, the likes of Conor McMenamin who also plays Ireland U19, he comes from Letterkenny so how will his status be viewed if there\\'s a hard border, or no deal, or if they\\'re suddenly classed as a player from another country? \"I want to make sure that rugby, and sport in general, is at the top table and secure going forward.\" Despite fears around added costs and paperwork associated with Brexit, all-Ireland sport remains a source of pride for most clubs and the pinnacle of many players\\' career and this is unlikely to change. When it comes to sport, the result is only certain at the final whistle and Brexit is no different. As Andrew Cassidy said, sports fans are used to the highs and lows, and Brexit or no Brexit, they\\'ll follow their team across any border.'}, {'date': '2019-04-28', 'title': \"Brexit: Wales' first minister refuses to back another vote\", 'content': 'Wales\\' first minister has refused to back a promise to hold another Brexit referendum as part of Labour\\'s manifesto for May\\'s European elections.

Shadow Treasury ministers Clive Lewis and Anneliese Dodds and the shadow minister for disabled people Marsha de Cordova are among the frontbenchers backing the call for a confirmatory vote in any eventuality - not just to avoid a \"bad deal\".

That is a decision the national executive of the party will make.\" Asked if the promise of a public confirmatory vote would be in election material, he added: \"It\\'s important that the party, which is a democratic party structure, makes those decisions. Sadly, or perhaps it\\'s a good thing, I\\'m not a dictator of the Labour Party.\" Analysis by Iain Watson, BBC political correspondent When some of Labour\\'s early European election literature was leaked, it provoked an internal row at a senior level. Why? Because it made no mention of another referendum. A letter from almost 100 MPs and MEPs calling for one has put additional pressure on the leadership. With the agreement of a senior official in Jeremy Corbyn\\'s office, the campaign literature is now to be rewritten. There will be a mention of a confirmatory ballot/public vote (translation: a referendum) but only to avoid \"a bad Tory deal\". This won\\'t go far enough for those MPs calling for a referendum on any deal. That is, even if Mr Corbyn reaches agreement on a \"soft\" Brexit with Theresa May, a chunk of his Parliamentary party still want another referendum. The issue will be hammered out when the ruling national executive meets on Tuesday to decide the manifesto for the European elections. Some members will argue for no referendum, some will argue for one but with caveats, and others will press for a public vote under all circumstances. Maybe the printing presses should be mothballed until Wednesday. A letter, signed by some Labour MPs and MEPs, said: \"Our members need to feel supported on doorsteps by a clear manifesto that marks us out as the only viable alternative to Nigel Farage\\'s Brexit Party. \"We need a message of hope and solidarity, and we need to campaign for it without caveats. To motivate our supporters, and to do the right thing by our members and our policy, a clear commitment to a confirmatory public vote on any Brexit deal must be part of our European election manifesto. \"We understand the many different pressures and views within our movement, but without this clear commitment, we fear that our electoral coalition could fall apart.\" Richard Corbett, leader of Labour\\'s MEPs and a member of the NEC, told BBC Radio 4\\'s Today programme: \"The problem we face now is that Brexit is turning out to be so different from what was promised three years ago. \"Remember they said it would be easy - it\\'s turning out to be rather complex. They said it would save loads of money that would all go to the NHS - it\\'s turning out to be costly. \"They said it would not damage the economy - we are seeing firms move abroad, jobs lost, especially in manufacturing. \"Because it\\'s so different, it\\'s right that it should go back to the people for a final sign-off.\"'}, {'date': '2019-04-28', 'title': 'Brexit: Tom Watson steps up call for Labour referendum pledge', 'content': 'Labour\\'s deputy leader has stepped up calls for his party to promise a referendum on any Brexit deal in its European elections manifesto. Tom Watson urged party members to message Labour\\'s ruling national executive committee to call for a \"confirmatory ballot\" pledge. The NEC meets on Tuesday to decide on Labour\\'s campaign manifesto. But frontbencher Barry Gardiner said a referendum on any Brexit deal would be a change in Labour policy. The shadow international trade secretary told BBC Radio 5 Live\\'s Pienaar\\'s Politics that the party\\'s policy agreed at last year\\'s conference was to go for a referendum \"to stop a no-deal or a bad Tory Brexit.\" He added: \"If we are being pushed into a no-deal by this government, we will have a second referendum.

But if it cannot force one, it added, the party \"must support all options remaining on the table, including campaigning for a public vote\". However, following parliamentary deadlock and a refusal by MPs to approve the withdrawal deal negotiated between the EU and UK, Labour has entered into cross-party talks with the Conservatives to see if they can reach a consensus. And many Labour members now want the party to make its agreement to any deal conditional on it being put to a public vote - what Labour calls a \"confirmatory ballot\". Mr Watson has been among figures calling for that pledge to be included in Labour\\'s European Parliamentary elections campaign, arguing it is needed to counter the electoral challenge posed by Nigel Farage\\'s newly formed Brexit Party. On Friday it emerged that more than 90 Labour MPs and MEPs had written to the NEC, urging a \"clear commitment\" to a public vote on any Brexit deal agreed. Asked whether another referendum was a \"red line\" for Labour in the talks, shadow business secretary Rebecca Long-Bailey told Sky News: \"We are not being hugely prescriptive on the minute detail of specific elements because we are willing to compromise and we are willing to be flexible\". She said she was \"hopeful\" that in coming weeks \"we will see some movement\" in the talks. If all of the party\\'s criteria was not met, she said \"all options are on the table which includes campaigning for a public vote\". And shadow communities secretary Andrew Gwynne told the BBC\\'s Andrew Marr Show he expected the NEC to \"endorse Labour\\'s policy that came out of the conference\". Mr Gwynne said: \"I want to ensure that we avoid a bad Tory Brexit or a no-deal scenario. In those circumstances, yes, I think that wasn\\'t on the ballot paper in 2016, we should then perhaps ask the people \\'is this actually what you want, a confirmatory vote, do you support what the government\\'s proposition is?\\'. \"But let\\'s see what comes out of these talks because I hope that the government can move on some of these red lines so that we can get a more sensible approach towards Brexit going forwards.\" But Lib Dem deputy leader Jo Swinson, whose party launched its European parliamentary elections campaign on Friday with a \"stop Brexit\" message, told the BBC: \"Every Liberal Democrat vote is a vote to stop Brexit. \"A vote for Labour is a vote for Brexit. Nigel Farage and Boris Johnson will use those votes to say the British people want Brexit to happen.\" There is some opposition to another referendum within Labour, amid concern about alienating party voters who backed Leave. Earlier this month 25 Labour backbenchers wrote to Mr Corbyn, urging him to rule one out and arguing that it would \"be exploited by the far right, damage the trust of many core Labour voters and reduce our chances of winning a general election\".'}, {'date': '2019-04-24', 'title': \"Brexit: What is the SNP's policy?\", 'content': 'The Scottish National Party (SNP) has consistently voted against Theresa May\\'s Brexit deal in Westminster. The party has also pushed the UK government to rule out leaving the European Union (EU) with no deal, arguing that such an outcome would have a \"severe and disproportionate\" impact on Scotland. So what is the SNP\\'s Brexit policy? The Scottish government\\'s ultimate objective, of course, is for an independent Scotland that is a full member of the European Union. If the UK ended up leaving the EU, which it is currently scheduled to do by 31 October, the SNP says it would seek a second referendum on Scottish independence by 2021. The party is strongly opposed to Brexit, and points out that Scotland voted \"overwhelmingly\" in favour of staying in the EU in the referendum - with the result 62% Remain and 38% Leave. Scotland\\'s First Minister, Nicola Sturgeon, has previously said that the 35 SNP MPs at Westminster would back any proposals for a confirmatory referendum on the Brexit terms - a so-called \"People\\'s Vote\". But if the option to remain is not available, the SNP says it could not support any Brexit deal that does not include Scotland remaining a member of both the EU single market and customs union. It says this could be done either through a differentiated deal that would see Scotland stay in both when the rest of the UK leaves - or through its preferred option of the UK as a whole retaining full membership of them. So what would it mean in practice if the SNP\\'s policy was adopted and the UK remained in the single market and customs union? Please upgrade your browser Under this version of Brexit, the UK would continue to have full access to the single market and very few trade barriers with the EU. That means there would be the same friction-free flow of goods to and from the remaining 27 member countries. The SNP says remaining in the single market would \"protect jobs, living standards, our economy and public services\". But by remaining part of the customs union, the UK would not be allowed to negotiate its own free trade deals with countries outside the EU. The UK would also be tied to EU rules and regulations and it would have very little capacity to change them. That\\'s because having left the EU, the UK would no longer have any MEPs or representation on the European Commission. Also, despite no longer being an EU member, the UK would have to abide by freedom of movement rules. So EU citizens would still be allowed to live and work in the UK and vice versa. The UK would also have to continue to make a contribution to the EU budget, although the exact amount would be subject to negotiation. Currently, the UK pays about £10.8bn net a year. The UK would, though, be able to leave both the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) and the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) which would save money in EU budget contributions and allow the UK to set its own policy in these areas. But the more the UK restricts access for EU boats to UK fishing waters, the more the EU is likely to restrict access for UK fish produce to EU markets. At the moment, there is no country in Europe that is a member of both the single market and the customs union, but not part of the EU. So the SNP is arguing for an arrangement that would be unique. The closest equivalent would be Norway, which is not part of the EU, but is part of the single market, through its membership of the European Free Trade Association (EFTA). The other EFTA members are Iceland, Liechtenstein and Switzerland. In order to continue to have access to the single market, the UK would need to formally apply to EFTA to become its fifth member. The EFTA has its own court, but it still needs to pay heed to European Court of Justice rulings when it comes to disputes involving EU law. But Norway is not part of the customs union, something which the SNP also wants the UK to retain. Mrs May has resisted any previous attempts to go along with a Norway-style Brexit model, arguing that it \"wouldn\\'t deliver on the vote of the British people\". However, it would alleviate the problem of preventing a possible hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic - something for which negotiators on both sides are still trying to find a long-term solution. Speaking of Northern Ireland, the SNP is unhappy with the Irish \"backstop\" proposal contained in the draft withdrawal agreement which Theresa May has negotiated. The backstop would be triggered if the transition period expires without a new trade deal being ready in time. The SNP argues that if this happens, Northern Ireland will gain a competitive advantage over Scotland. That\\'s because Northern Ireland would be in a deeper customs relationship with the EU, and it would be closer entwined with the rules of the single market than the rest of the UK. Ms Sturgeon says this would mean Northern Ireland businesses would get easier access to the single market, which she fears would have a \"devastating\" impact on Scottish jobs and investment. The SNP\\'s argument is: if Northern Ireland can have such arrangements, why can\\'t Scotland? The UK government\\'s answer is that the backstop is needed to protect the Good Friday peace agreement and that Northern Ireland is in a unique situation, given it shares a physical border with an EU country. This amounts to another reason why the SNP favours continued membership of the customs union and the single market for the whole of the UK.

People could then choose between an independent Wales at Europe\\'s \"heart\" or a \"forgotten second-class region in a dying British state,\" he said. The independence call goes further than his party conference speech in March. Polling for BBC Wales has put support for independence at less than 10% since 2011. Mr Price said Wales should hold a \"new national conversation\" about the country\\'s future whatever happens with the UK\\'s departure from the European Union. In last month\\'s speech to party members, in Bangor, he called for an independence referendum if a series of post-Brexit demands were not met. His demands included a call for European funding for Wales to be guaranteed, cuts in VAT for tourism and construction, the devolution of powers over air passenger duty, and control over migration policy. But now Mr Price has gone further by making a Welsh independence referendum dependent on whether Brexit goes ahead without a second EU referendum. \"It is broken Westminster, not the EU, which has failed the people of Wales,\" he said. \"I do not believe that the poverty facing our country is inevitable and nor will these problems be fixed by Brexit. \"They will be fixed by taking our future into our own hands and becoming a nation in our own right.\" His comments follow a demand by the Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon on Wednesday for a second referendum on Scottish independence by 2021 if Scotland is taken out of the EU. Mr Price added: \"Whatever happens with Brexit over the next few months we should begin a new national conversation about what kind of future we want for Wales by establishing a Welsh Citizen\\'s Assembly along the lines proposed in Scotland.\" Asked to choose between a range of options in terms of Welsh powers, only 7% of Welsh voters backed the idea of Welsh independence in the 2019 St David\\'s Day poll for BBC Wales - support has been less than 10% since 2011.

The UK is due to leave the EU on 31 October, after Brexit was delayed, amid continuing parliamentary deadlock. It means the UK must now hold European elections on 23 May, or leave on 1 June without a deal.

Last month, the Department for Transport (DfT) was forced to settle with train operator Eurotunnel, which had challenged the procurement of no-deal Brexit shipping contracts. As part of the deal, Eurotunnel agreed to make improvements to its terminal. P&O argues that this put its business at a \"competitive disadvantage\". Eurotunnel\\'s case came after the DfT awarded contracts worth more than £100m in total to three firms - Brittany Ferries, DFDS and Seaborne Freight. The companies were to provide extra capacity across the Channel in the event that a no-deal Brexit led to congestion at UK ports. In February, the DfT was forced to cancel its contract with Seaborne, which the BBC found had never run a ferry service. The government was criticised for not having run a full public procurement process, and Eurotunnel subsequently sued, claiming it had never been considered for a contract, despite having previously run a cross-channel ferry service. The DfT, led by Transport Secretary Chris Grayling, settled the claim out of court for £33m. The government was keen to stress that the money would be used by Eurotunnel to upgrade its facilities in Folkestone, including installing new scanners and changing traffic routing. At the time, experts said that this provision could amount to illegal state aid. Andrew Dean, from law firm Clifford Chance said it \"could be construed as another piece of public procurement without open and transparent competition\". P&O, which did not bid for the original ferry contracts, is now challenging the Eurotunnel settlement. \"We have repeatedly made clear during decades of providing vital transport services between Britain and the Continent that we are happy to compete with other providers on a level playing field. \"We also fully accept that it was prudent of the government to make contingency plans to protect international supply chains in the event of a hard Brexit. \"However, we do not believe that the payment of £33m of public money to Eurotunnel to settle its legal challenge to these plans is fair or reasonable. \"It is explicitly designed to be invested in the tunnel\\'s infrastructure and if left unchallenged would put our services at a competitive disadvantage.\" A government spokeswoman said: \"We are confident we acted appropriately in reaching the agreement with Eurotunnel.\" By Emily Heard, Head of Procurement, Competition and State Aid at law firm Bevan Brittan P&O\\'s potential grounds include a claim that the £33m payment to Eurotunnel amounts to a contract, which should have been advertised under the Public Contracts Regulations 2015. The remedies include setting aside the contract, damages and a fine. The interesting question here is whether securing \"Improvement Projects\" as part of the Eurotunnel settlement agreement turns an otherwise lawful settlement agreement into an unlawful public contract. P&O may also be arguing that the settlement amounts to unlawful state aid, on the grounds that it confers an advantage on Eurotunnel over its competitors. If unlawful state aid is found, the government would have to recover the aid in full, with interest, and damages may be payable to P&O. The extent to which the settlement represents fair value will be highly relevant here.'}, {'date': '2019-04-24', 'title': 'Conservative MP Lucy Allan welcomes Brexit Party candidates', 'content': 'A Conservative politician has welcomed the \"fantastic\" candidates put forward by a rival political party ahead of the EU elections.

The shadow foreign secretary urged ministers to accept that a customs union with the EU was the way to avoid a hard border and preserve peace. Cabinet Office Minister David Lidington rejected a link between the border or customs arrangements and the murder. Treasury minister Liz Truss said it was \"very wrong\" to connect the two. Prime Minister Theresa May, President of Ireland Michael D Higgins, Taoiseach (Irish prime minister) Leo Varadkar and Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn were among those who attended Ms McKee\\'s funeral in Belfast. She was shot dead on Thursday while observing rioting in Londonderry. Cross-party talks have been going on for a number of weeks to try to break the Brexit impasse. On Tuesday, the prime minister\\'s spokesman hinted that Labour was slowing down the process, while Jeremy Corbyn blamed the government for the ongoing deadlock. One of the main sticking points is how to maintain an open border on the island of Ireland after Brexit when it becomes the dividing line between the UK and the EU. Ms Thornberry, who was standing in for Mr Corbyn at Prime Minister\\'s Questions, said the statement from the New IRA accepting responsibility for the death of Ms McKee was a \"sickening throwback to the days we thought we\\'d left behind 20 years ago\". \"This is one of the central reasons we must find an answer to the Northern Irish border question rather than give these evil terrorists the divisions that they crave,\" she said. She urged the government to get \"serious\" about the cross-party talks and realise that Labour\\'s preferred option of a customs union with the EU was the obvious solution. Labour says this would remove the need for customs checks and potentially controversial infrastructure at the border. Mr Lidington, Mrs May\\'s de facto deputy, said he did not believe those behind Ms McKee\\'s killing \"were motivated by any thoughts about the border or customs arrangements\". He said the \"substance\" and \"tone\" of the cross-party talks had been \"constructive\". \"I think there is a genuine attempt to try to find a way through,\" he said. \"But I\\'m not going to hide the fact that this is very difficult, because if it\\'s going to work it\\'ll mean both parties needing to make compromises and us ending up with a solution that unlike any other so far proposed will get a majority in the House.\" However, Ms Thornberry said the government did not appear to have plans on how to maintain an \"invisible border\" between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland after Brexit. She quoted a leaked Home Office presentation, which said there was no budget for such a scheme and it could not be introduced before 2030 due to technological constraints. Mr Lidington said the government had invested £20m to work on \"alternative measures\" that would bring seamless trade to the border. Chief Secretary to the Treasury Liz Truss told BBC Politics Live that Ms Thornberry was \"very wrong to link that whole debate with that appalling act of terrorism\". \"The prime minister has always been absolutely clear that the union is her number one priority,\" she said. \"It\\'s the reason that we\\'ve been so careful and I don\\'t think it is right to link those two issues in Prime Minister\\'s Questions.\" But Liberal Democrat MP Layla Moran said Ms Thornberry was \"right\" and \"brave\" to make the link. BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said it was \"surprising\" how explicit Ms Thornberry was in doing so. She said there were very real fears from all communities about a potential rise in violence in Northern Ireland and the Republic, but David Lidington not willing to make that explicit connection himself. \"I suspect not everyone in the House of Commons will be comfortable that she made it,\" our correspondent added.'}, {'date': '2019-04-24', 'title': 'Ann Widdecombe: Former Tory MP to stand for Brexit Party', 'content': 'Former Conservative MP Ann Widdecombe has announced she is set to return to politics - for the Brexit Party.

She said she wanted to \"fire a very loud warning shot across the bows\" of the established parties. The former shadow home secretary has been retired since 2010. Ms Widdecombe told BBC News she was standing out of \"total frustration\" and to show Parliament to \"get on with it\" or see their seats \"in danger\". She added: \"Britain is an international laughing stock. Parliament is beyond parody, and the whole nation is fed up to the back teeth and just wants a resolution. \"I believe that if the Brexit Party can make enormous gains in the European elections and win overwhelmingly, that will send shockwaves - both in Labour heartlands and in Tory shires. \"It will make MPs rethink what they are doing as it will be a big reaffirmation of the people\\'s vote.\" The UK has been given an extension to the Brexit process until 31 October, meaning participation in the European elections on 23 May looks likely. In addition to Mr Farage\\'s new venture, Change UK - formerly The Independent Group - launched its European election campaign in Bristol on Tuesday. Interim leader Heidi Allen said Change UK was \"the home of the Remain alliance\". Meanwhile, cross-party talks between the government and Labour, aimed at forging a common way forward on Brexit, are continuing amid recriminations at the slow pace of progress. Prime Minister Theresa May\\'s official spokesman said that while the discussions with Labour were \"serious\" they were proving \"difficult\" in some areas, and that progress was needed \"urgently\" to enable Britain to leave the EU as soon as possible. Labour, however, put the blame for lack of progress on the government\\'s refusal to shift on its \"red lines\". The European Parliamentary elections are expected to take place in the UK on 23 May - if the UK has not left the EU by that date. The UK is divided into 11 regions and parties can put forward a list of candidates for each one.

Shadow Brexit secretary Keir Starmer, shadow chancellor John McDonnell, shadow business secretary Rebecca Long-Bailey and shadow environment secretary Sue Hayman took part on behalf of Labour.

Leading backbencher Nigel Evans called on Mrs May to step down as prime minister \"as soon as possible\", adding that the PM \"had been reaching out to the Labour Party and Jeremy Corbyn, when she should have been reaching out to the people\". Talks between Labour and the government seem to be faltering on two fronts - timing and substance. Both sides say there has been serious engagement. But the prime minister wants the talks concluded urgently to give her a chance of cancelling the UK\\'s participation in the European parliamentary elections. That means getting a deal through Parliament by 22 May. If it looks like an agreement can\\'t be reached with the opposition quickly, Theresa May wants them jointly to sign up to a series of parliamentary votes that both sides would regard as binding, to try to break the impasse. But Labour doesn\\'t appear willing to be rushed. And the main opposition party says Mrs May still needs to erase her red line on a customs union if she is to make progress. Sources say the issue was discussed at the cabinet today - but, while no votes were taken, there didn\\'t seem to be a majority in favour of doing so. As things stand, the Brexit deadlock continues - and the European election campaigns are getting under way. Senior members of the influential 1922 committee of Tory MPs are meeting in Parliament. Under current party rules, MPs cannot call another no-confidence vote in the prime minister until December - but the committee is expected to discuss whether steps should be taken to try to change that. The group\\'s joint executive secretary Mr Evans told BBC Radio 4\\'s Today programme the calls for the prime minister to quit had become \"a clamour\". \"The only way we\\'re going to break this impasse properly is if we have fresh leadership of the Conservative Party,\" he said. But prisons minister Rory Stewart said Mrs May was doing a \"good job\" and deserved \"praise not blame\". \"It\\'s nothing to do with the individual, it\\'s that people disagree deeply about Brexit,\" he added. The comments came after it emerged that Mrs May faces a no-confidence challenge from Tory campaigners. More than 70 local association chiefs have called for an extraordinary general meeting to discuss her leadership and a non-binding vote is to be held at the National Conservative Convention EGM in May. If the grass-roots Tory vote showed a lack of confidence - it could put greater pressure on the 1922 Committee to find some way of forcibly removing the PM from office. That pressure could increase further if the Tories poll badly in local and European elections on 2 and 23 May respectively. The UK has been given an extension to the Brexit process until 31 October.

This means the UK is likely to hold European Parliament elections on 23 May. Mr Farage launched his new Brexit Party last week and said it had a list of 70 candidates to fight the May elections. Mr Watson warned that Labour would not defeat Mr Farage \"by being mealy-mouthed and sounding as if we half agree with him\". \"We won\\'t beat him unless we can inspire the millions crying out for a different direction,\" he added. He said a \"confirmatory\" referendum and \"final say\" on any deal was \"the very least\" voters deserved, now they knew more about what Brexit would mean. He added: \"They deserve a Labour Party that offers clarity on this issue, as well as the radical vision for a new political economy achieved by working with our socialist allies inside the EU. \"And, above all, they deserve better than Nigel Farage\\'s promise of a far-right Brexit that would solve nothing.\" However, Mr Farage accused Mr Watson of breaking promises to the British people and said he intended to \"wholeheartedly target Labour lies and dishonesty in the weeks ahead\". Talks with the Conservatives aimed at breaking the Brexit deadlock have re-opened Labour\\'s divisions over a possible further referendum. Shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry wrote to cabinet colleagues to warn that striking a deal with the prime minister that ditched the commitment to a public vote would breach party policy. A survey earlier this year found that 70% of Labour members support another referendum, but nine of Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn\\'s top team are sceptical or opposed. Mr Farage\\'s Brexit Party also poses a threat to the Conservative Party, according to a survey for the Mail on Sunday. The Survation poll of 781 Conservative councillors found that 40% were planning to back the Brexit Party at the May European elections. Just over half - 52% - said they would vote for their own party. If Brexiteer Boris Johnson was prime minister this figure would rise to 65%, the survey found. Some 15% said they believed Mr Farage would be the best leader of the Conservative Party - only Mr Johnson was ahead of him, on 19%. By Nick Eardley, BBC political correspondent Nigel Farage relishes the opportunity to put a cat among the pigeons - and once again the two biggest parties are questioning how to deal with his unambiguous pro-Brexit message. Tom Watson\\'s case is that Labour needs to be different. He\\'s not impressed with the idea of \"sounding as if we half agree\" with Mr Farage, urging his party to strengthen its message on another referendum and provide a natural home to those on the other side of the Brexit debate. The problem is that some in the Labour completely disagree. They think it would an historic mistake to ignore Labour voters who backed Leave in 2016 and believe it may actually encourage those voters to side with Mr Farage. The Conservatives are grappling with how to fight the European elections too. Today\\'s poll in the Mail on Sunday suggests some Conservative councillors are prepared to turn their back on the party - at least temporarily - and support Mr Farage. That will only feed into fears in the Tory leadership that these elections could be a disaster for the party - and strengthen resolve to try to stop them happening by getting a deal through Parliament. The picture isn\\'t the same everywhere. In Scotland, for example, the pro-referendum SNP appear to be maintaining strong support. But Mr Farage will continue to argue that the main parties have failed to honour the referendum result. And his allies suspect that message will prove a powerful one for Brexit supporters if the European Parliament elections go ahead. Although Theresa May has said she still wants the UK to leave the EU as soon as possible, she is yet to get her withdrawal deal  - which has been rejected three times by MPs - approved by Parliament. Cross-party talks between the government and the Labour Party are continuing, to find a way through the impasse. Labour wants a new permanent customs union with the EU, which would allow tariff-free trade in goods. The government has repeatedly ruled out remaining in the EU\\'s customs union, arguing it would prevent the UK from setting its own trade policy.

The Fraser of Allander Institute (FAI), part of the University of Strathclyde, predicts a loss of more than one £1 in every £20 of output from the economy. It suggests the fall from peak to trough in the economy could be around 5.5% of total output, contracting for two whole years. This is in line with forecasts made by the Bank of England for the UK economy. The FAI modelled several possible Brexit outcomes and the impact in its latest economic commentary. This included scenarios of a no-deal Brexit with and without policy response. Despite the potential for loss, researchers expect the damage to be offset by action taken by governments and the Bank of England. And the FAI has set out a possible growth path for the Scottish economy which could see it outperform current estimates if Brexit is well-managed, business confidence returns and investment picks up. The central forecast for the economy is slightly weaker than the last such report from the economics institute. It predicts only 1.1% growth this year, followed by 1.4% next year and 1.5% the year after. While much economic attention has been focused on Brexit in recent months, the economists warn that major questions are being ignored or avoided by governments in Edinburgh and London. Reflecting on the difference made by the Scottish parliament 20 years after it was first elected, Wednesday\\'s report says the weakest part of its performance has been \"the lack of evaluation and scrutiny of the effectiveness and value of policy initiatives\". It questions whether there has been any progress on a Whitehall initiative to find ways for governments and their agencies to work better together in the interests of the Scottish economy. It says there should be a renewed focus on sustainable growth, after most targets set by the incoming Scottish government in 2007 have been missed. The report says there is a need to address big structural changes coming to the economy, including demographic change, the scaling back of the oil and gas sector, automation and emerging economies around the world. At the same time, it says there should be an assumption that government budgets will remain tight, demand for the health service continues to grow, and little discussion takes place of the squeeze on public services that are not protected by having the high priority for the NHS and schools. The report calls for stronger cross-party co-operation in the Scottish Parliament, pointing to the impasse on Brexit in Westminster as the outcome of consensus policy-making breaking down. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon will focus on Brexit when she speaks at the STUC conference in Dundee later, where she is expected to say nobody should pretend that the \"damage\" of Brexit can be fully mitigated, She will also warn that Brexit, in any form, will harm living standards and risk jobs.

Mrs May has pledged to pursue an \"orderly\" Brexit while acknowledging that \"the whole country is intensely frustrated that this process of leaving the European Union has not been completed.\" Meanwhile, the government is continuing to make plans for the UK leaving without a deal. Graeme Roy, director of the Fraser of Allander Institute, said that last week\\'s delay in the deadline for Brexit only \"kicked the can down the road\", with little evidence so far of UK policy makers being able to agree a compromise approach. The risks to the economy therefore remain high. He added: \"Brexit should not be the only focus of attention. One consequence of the Brexit debate is that it has left little room for discussion of the emerging structural challenges and opportunities our economy is facing.\" John Macintosh, tax partner at Deloitte, the accountancy firm that sponsors the regular Allander economic commentary, said the latest report underlined strong employment figures, but there is a pressing need to encourage investment and to improve productivity\".

Elections were held on Thursday for 248 English councils, six mayors, and all 11 councils in Northern Ireland. No elections took place in Scotland or Wales.

But Mr Duncan Smith, a leading Brexiteer, said many Conservatives would refuse to back any deal reached between the two parties.

In the wake of the Conservatives\\' local election losses, senior Tories have called for the party to compromise in order to reach an agreement with Labour to end the Brexit deadlock. Scottish Tory leader Ruth Davidson called for the negotiating teams of both parties - who are currently locked in talks - to \"get Brexit sorted, get a deal over the line and let Britain move on\". Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the Conservative Party needed to listen to the election results and be \"in the mood for compromise\". Speaking to BBC Radio 4\\'s Today programme, he said the Conservatives might have to move towards Labour\\'s proposal of a permanent customs union - a move many Brexiteers in the party oppose - in order to solve the impasse in Westminster. Mrs May\\'s government has previously ruled out remaining in a customs union after the UK leaves the EU, arguing it would prevent the UK from setting its own trade policy. Labour has said the EU may show flexibility over the issue and allow the UK \"a say\" in future trade deals. Mr Hancock suggested \"coming up with something in-between\", and called for \"an open dialogue in which we can make an agreement\".

But he also warned that a customs union would not be a \"long-term solution\". Shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer said Mr Hunt\\'s remarks on a customs union provided \"yet more evidence\" that many in the cabinet believed the \"most important thing right now\" was the race to be Mrs May\\'s successor. Labour\\'s MP for Redcar, Anna Turley, also reacted to Mr Hunt\\'s comments that a customs union was not a long-term solution, tweeting: \"This is why we can\\'t trust the Tories by doing a deal stitched up in Number 10 which they will seek to unravel under their next leader.\"'}, {'date': '2019-04-17', 'title': 'Has Brexit fractured Irish-unionist relations?', 'content': 'Last week marked 21 years since the Good Friday peace agreement was signed - the deal that effectively helped bring decades of violence in Northern Ireland to an end.

Another unintended consequence of Brexit seems to have been the impact on relations between unionists and the Irish government.

All unionist parties in Northern Ireland are opposed to the backstop, but the Irish government insists it must endure in the agreement until another workable solution can be found. Mrs Little-Pengelly accused the Irish government of \"completely and aggressively\" dismissing unionist concerns in relation to the withdrawal agreement and suggested it had damaged relations in a way that would be difficult to rebuild. However, that is a claim the Irish government has always rejected. Just as recently as last week, Taoiseach (Irish Prime Minister) Leo Varadkar said he believed his government had a \"good relationship\" with the DUP and that they communicated at all levels. But has Brexit irreparably damaged relations built up over the past two decades? Former DUP adviser Tim Cairns said he did not think they were broken beyond repair, but he puts the blame for much of the friction at the feet of the Irish government. He said he believed that if Leo Varadkar and his current Tánaiste  (Deputy PM) Simon Coveney, had been in charge in 1998, then there would not have been a peace agreement at all. \"They don\\'t possess relational qualities - there seems to be no capacity for relationship building,\" he added. He accused them of not understanding \"the relational nature of politics\" in Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland and said Mr Varadkar could learn lessons from one of his predecessors, Bertie Ahern. Mr Ahern was taoiseach during the talks that led to the Good Friday Agreement and worked on subsequent Stormont deals including the 2006 St Andrews Agreement before leaving office in 2008. A matter of weeks ago, Mr Ahern attended an event in memory of the late DUP leader, Ian Paisley Senior. Mr Cairns said Mr Ahern had understood that in order to cut a deal, there is a \"need to reach across\" - but that because the UK government had agreed to the backstop, he believed that the Irish government did not feel a need to reach out. Brexit has certainly created a more frosty political atmosphere and with it, harsher exchanges of language. It is not just the DUP that has accused the Irish government of ramping up tensions. The Ulster Unionist Party\\'s leader Robin Swann attended the Fine Gael conference in October, and said some comments the Irish government had made about Brexit \"were like a poke in the eye to unionists\". He said when his party raised legitimate concerns over the backstop, that seemed to be met with a \"suck-it-up attitude\". That being said, a former taoiseach told BBC News NI that while he believes personal relations with unionists remain positive, Brexit has had \"inevitable consequences\" on political relationships. John Bruton, who was Irish prime minister from 1994 until 1997, said Brexit had fractured relationships - but it was not through anything the Irish government had done. \"I regret to say the DUP by supporting Brexit has contributed directly, and foreseeably, to the situation we have today,\" he said. He also rejected the suggestion that the Irish government acted aggressively in the negotiations. \"We didn\\'t want Brexit. What the Irish government has done consistently is to explain the consequences of Brexit on the Good Friday Agreement.\" \"It\\'s not about adjectives, it\\'s about substance,\" he added, explaining that name-calling and describing relations as \"toxic\" was not helpful to anyone. It is perhaps worth noting that it was not always like this. Back in 2012, Simon Coveney became the first Irish government minister to attend a DUP conference. At the time, Mr Coveney said his appearance at the conference in the La Mon hotel was further proof of the \"increasing trust\" among politicians in Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. Last month, the DUP\\'s chief whip Sir Jeffrey Donaldson was on a panel at the Fine Gael conference - but on Wednesday, Mr Coveney told the Dáil (Irish Parliament) he had not had any \"detailed discussions\" with DUP politicians since then. It seems the seismic events at Westminster that have impacted political relationships, mean there is now much more work for both sides to do, if they want to restore and keep building trust.'}, {'date': '2019-04-10', 'title': 'Brexit: May awaits EU Brexit extension decision', 'content': 'Theresa May is waiting to hear the decision of the other 27 EU leaders, who are discussing her request for a short delay to Brexit.

Reuters reports that the French president told the summit a delay beyond 30 June would jeopardise the EU.

At least 4 other countries in favour of extension cut-off to be the autumn NB EU leaders need to reach unanimity by law End of Twitter post  by @BBCkatyaadler Earlier Mrs May said she \"regretted\" that the UK had not already left, adding that she had \"been clear\" with the EU that she was only seeking a short delay to Brexit. Ahead of the summit, European Council President Donald Tusk said \"neither side should be allowed to feel humiliated\" and urged the other 27 leaders to back a flexible extension of up to a year. Mrs May said the UK could leave the EU whenever a deal was ratified by Parliament - meaning the exit date could be by 22 May - the day before the European Parliament elections. This is a huge moment, a really vital night for the prime minister, who for so long told us repeatedly she wanted to keep the option of leaving without a deal on the table. But that has completely changed. She now believes that would be a huge mistake, that that could be a complete disaster, and therefore tonight she is arguing to avoid that at almost any cost. Tonight, whatever Theresa May says, the ultimate decision is with the European Union. It is absolutely clear at the moment what happens next to her - and what happens next at home - is not in British hands tonight. If no extension is granted, the default position would be for the UK to leave the EU at 23:00 BST on Friday, 12 April without a deal. So far, MPs have rejected the withdrawal agreement Mrs May reached with other European leaders last year and the House of Commons has also voted against leaving without a deal. The EU\\'s chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, said the \"only way to ensure an orderly withdrawal of the UK\" was for Parliament to agree the withdrawal agreement, and any extension \"has to be useful and serve a purpose\". Mrs May said she knew many people would be \"frustrated that the summit is taking place at all\", but its purpose was \"to agree a deal to enable us to leave the EU in that smooth and orderly way\". She said the extra time to get a deal through Parliament was \"in everybody\\'s interest\". Asked if she would accept a longer extension, she said: \"I have asked for an extension to 30 June. The PM has previously said she was \"not prepared to delay Brexit any further than 30 June\". Please upgrade your browser Use the list below or select a button EU officials prepared a draft document for the leaders to discuss at the summit - but the end date of the delay was left blank for them to fill in once deliberations ended. BBC Europe correspondent Kevin Connolly said \"much has been spelled out in advance\", including the condition that the UK would have to hold European Parliament elections if it remained in the EU at the end of May - or else be forced to leave immediately. The UK would also be expected to commit to not disrupting EU business - such as the preparation of the next budget - and its influence \"would be sharply reduced and its voice muted\". Arriving in Brussels, German Chancellor Angela Merkel said the leaders needed to discuss Mrs May\\'s request \"openly and constructively\", and she had \"no doubt\" there would be unity over an extension. She said: \"The greatest interest for us is an orderly withdrawal of the UK from the EU and to maintain the unity of the 27.\" Irish Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said he did not anticipate that the UK would leave the EU on Friday, and he was \"very confident\" that an extension will be agreed at the summit. \"What is still open is how long that extension will be and what the conditions will be,\" he added. But French President Emmanuel Macron said \"nothing is settled, and in particular no long extension\". He said he was \"impatient\" to hear \"clear proposals\" from Mrs May, and leaders would need \"a lot of calm, a lot of determination and a lot of sang-froid\". President Macron added: \"I believe deeply that we are carrying out a European rebirth, and I don\\'t want the subject of Brexit to get in the way of that.\" Meanwhile, DUP leader Arlene Foster and Northern Ireland MEP Diane Dodds will meet Mr Barnier on Thursday, with Conservative MPs Iain Duncan Smith and Owen Paterson. Ms Foster said the prime minister had \"limped along and tried to force people into a cul-de-sac\" in trying to get support for her \"bad\" deal.'}, {'date': '2019-04-20', 'title': 'Brexit and the economy: the cost of kicking cans', 'content': \"Whatever else happened with Brexit, a weakened pound and the widespread message that Scotland remains open to Europe - whatever England's up to - should have kept tourism from the continent at a healthy high level. But it's not looking that way. Economic uncertainty - not just in Britain but around it - has seen a falling away in numbers, at least at the start of the year. It's obviously not the most important time of year for the industry, but it is increasingly a year-round line of work. That finding was according to one of the surveys out recently, which was giving us an dashboard of updates on the strange economic goings-on in pre-Brexit Britain. The rest of the Scottish Chambers of Commerce quarterly survey was as you might expect, if you keep across the other headlines: a sharp deterioration in outlook, investment down in every sector other than construction, and orders down. That was especially so for manufacturing - with the worst confidence levels since 2012 - and even more so for manufacturing exports. That reflects problems for the eurozone, which might also help explain the fall-off in visitor numbers. The slowdown across the region has been heading for recessionary territory, so overseas travel may be a discretionary spend people were choosing to do without. The British economy, having moved from fastest-growing large economy to the slowest, now finds itself having company in the slow lane. The other significant message from the Chambers of Commerce survey (like quite a few others, it was carried out by the Fraser of Allander Institute at Strathclyde University) is that cost pressures are on the rise. The oil price rise has broached the $70 point again, which ought to be good for much of the oil and gas sector, but puts cost into bits of the supply chain for manufacturing, retail and tourism. And the payroll bill is on the rise. According to the Chambers of Commerce survey, that's most noticeable in retail and construction. (It doesn't cover every sector, but samples Representative ones.) Automatic enrolment for pensions has stepped up substantially this month. There's the Apprenticeship Levy. And the so-called National Living Wage has seen an index-linked rise. The change in costs that is most dynamic results from the shortage of available recruits. Average pay was up 3.6% on winter of 2017-18, with inflation pegged just below its 2% target. In wage bargaining - if you can still call it that - trade unions and staff associations have the advantage. And as some push for more or to catch up, it's causing for a more lively environment for industrial action in pursuit of pay, covering offshore workers and staff in airports, teachers and conventional manufacturing, such as Volvo heavy plant factory in Lanarkshire. Despite all the uncertainty, last Tuesday, the Office for National Statistics published another month of frankly astonishing job figures. The number of Scots seeking work in the winter months was down 8000, to only 93,000, taking the unemployment rate to only 3.3%. To most economists, that is the kind of rate that counts as full employment, where the survey merely encounters the 'frictional' numbers, as people leave jobs and quickly take up new ones. There's a regular caveat at this point about the quality of jobs to be had, how they are bunched towards the lower end of the pay distribution, with disappointingly slow progression, even for those taking on promoted roles in managing others. That was borne out by figures from Eurostat, the official counters of European beans, showing the UK's payroll costs are only just above the EU average. Of the older 15 members - not including the catch-up states of the former communist east - only Portugal, Spain and Greece have lower wage costs. That makes for a dynamic economy, but it's also the low-wage economy that politicians told us they wanted to avoid - where low investment makes productivity exceptionally sluggish. And a reminder: even with full employment, it's only through rising productivity that we get collectively better off. Without that, we're standing still while others scoot ahead, and over time, that is reflected with diminished spending power in international markets. This is one explanation why the jobless numbers look so strong, against the backdrop of Brexit uncertainty. Economic commentators this week seemed to agree that low investment means managers are choosing to spend their money on more people, and on retaining staff, rather than sink scarce resource into less flexible investment in equipment or training, through which productivity can be expected to improve. Those familiar folk at Fraser of Allander put out their own periodical assessment of the economy, and pointed to the possibility that such a lack of investment could be backing up, in a potentially good way. If government and MPs ever get to clarity on future trading relationships with the EU27 and beyond, then the pent-up desire to push ahead with company growth could lead to (slightly) elevated growth rates next year and the one after. There was a hint of that also from the most recent Purchasing Managers survey. From IHS Markit data firm, with Royal Bank of Scotland as sponsor, it was downbeat about recent output, but much more positive about the 12-month horizon. But if not a managed Brexit, the Strathclyde economists were forecasting a disorderly 'no deal' departure would mean a drop in output of 5.5%, and a contracting economy in the next two years. The orderly variety would also mean contraction. To business, there was a sigh of relief that Britain didn't topple out of the European Union this month, but also a cry of despair that the can is being kicked further down the road. While MPs took the week off to recharge and regroup, business was totting up the cost of retaining its supply chain stockpiles, or to replenish those with a shelf-life. That carries cost, in stock and warehousing. Graeme Roy, leading the institute at Strathclyde, and with a recent insider's knowledge of the economic team at St Andrew's House, offers the additional observation that while we've been obsessing with Brexit, or getting a budget passed for next year, there are other and longer-term challenges that are getting sidelined. They include that sluggish productivity puzzle, and in public spending, the bits of the almost permanently-squeezed budget that don't get the political priority afforded to health or schools, which get further squeezed every year. You can hear the creaking discomfort around the nation's council chambers on a near daily basis. Twenty years after the first Scottish Parliament election, there's an Allander plea for a more strategic approach to the economic policies being pursued at Holyrood. There's an obvious reason why the economic growth targets set in 2007 by the incoming SNP administration have not been met - things went somewhat awry on a global scale the following year. But is there evidence of what works? The small business bonus scheme, for instance? It's popular with those who benefit, of course. But it's expensive, in terms of tax revenue foregone. And for what benefit in alternative investment and company growth by recipients?  We don't know. Unintentional consequences? We don't know about them either, because the Scottish government has chosen not to find out. At Holyrood, and even more obviously at Westminster, ministerial and civil service headspace seems to be entirely blocked out by constitutional issues - most immediately, Brexit planning and its potential widespread consequences. There's a price being paid in what's not being considered.\"}, {'date': '2019-04-11', 'title': 'Brexit: What happens now?', 'content': 'The EU and UK have agreed a further delay to Brexit until 31 October. So how will the deadlock be broken? The UK could leave earlier if a withdrawal agreement has been ratified by MPs. The country must now take part in European elections on 23 May - if it did not the UK would have to leave the EU on 1 June without a deal. The UK was originally due to leave on 29 March. The first extension shifted that date to 12 April. But now the UK now has just over six months to decide what it wants to do. Government ministers are continuing talks with Labour leaders to try to find a compromise deal. If they can agree, MPs will be given a chance to vote on the deal. If not, a range of alternative options will be put to them instead. In either case, the prime minister says the negotiated withdrawal agreement would remain unchanged. That\\'s the legally binding part of the Brexit deal that covers exit terms - including money, the transition period, citizen\\'s rights and the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic. There could be changes to the non-legally binding political declaration which sets out parameters for the long-term future relationship. Or new commitments on Britain\\'s future negotiating objectives could be written into legislation. The government is still committed to trying to leave the EU with a deal as soon as possible. But if the compromise plan does not yield results, many things could happen. No-deal Brexit is still the default outcome if MPs can\\'t agree anything else and there are no further extensions. If Parliament can\\'t agree a deal soon and the UK does not take part in the European elections on 23 May then a no-deal Brexit would happen on 1 June. If the elections do take place then the next deadline is now 31 October. It would also be possible for MPs to back a no-deal Brexit - although there has been a majority against that option when they have voted on it before. Despite the repeated rejection of Theresa May\\'s deal, it has not been permanently ruled out. Even now, if a compromise cannot be agreed with the Labour leader, and if there is no majority among MPs for an alternative, it remains a possibility. And with the longer Brexit delay now in place, the negotiated deal could come back at a later date as a way of allowing an early exit. Also, if negotiations with the EU on any alternative plan run into difficulties, the two sides could decide to return to the one deal that has been fully worked out. The government could choose to negotiate a completely new Brexit deal - perhaps in accordance with votes of MPs. This wouldn\\'t be a question of making small additions to the political declaration. Instead, there could be a complete renegotiation that would take some time - perhaps involving a rewrite of the withdrawal agreement which would take much longer. If the EU refused to re-enter negotiations, the government would have to plump for one of the other options instead. A further possibility is to hold another referendum. It could have the same status as the 2016 referendum, which was legally non-binding and advisory.  But some MPs want to hold a binding referendum where the result would automatically take effect - like with the 2011 referendum on changing the voting system for UK general elections. One widely discussed option would be for a \"confirmatory vote\" on whatever deal is finally agreed where the public would be given the choice between accepting the deal or remaining in the EU. Others argue that any further referendum should have the option of leaving the EU without a deal. Either way, a referendum can\\'t just happen automatically. The rules for referendums are set out in a law called the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000. There would have to be a new piece of legislation to make a referendum happen and to determine the rules, such as who would be allowed to vote. It couldn\\'t be rushed through, because there has to be time for the Electoral Commission to consider and advise on the referendum question. The question is then defined in the legislation. Once the legislation has been passed, the referendum couldn\\'t happen immediately either. There would have to be a statutory \"referendum period\" before the vote takes place. Experts at University College London\\'s Constitution Unit suggest that the minimum time for all of the required steps above is about 22 weeks. Theresa May could decide the best way out of the deadlock would be to hold an early general election. She doesn\\'t have the power just to call an election. But, as in 2017, she could ask MPs to vote for an early election under the terms of the Fixed Term Parliaments Act. Two-thirds of all MPs would need to support the move. The earliest date for the election would be 25 working days later but it could be after that - the prime minister would choose the precise date. The government survived a vote of no confidence on 16 January by 325 votes to 306. Labour could table another no confidence motion at any time. Under the Fixed Term Parliaments Act 2011, UK general elections are only supposed to happen every five years. The next one is due in 2022. But a vote of no confidence lets MPs vote on whether they want the government to continue. The motion must be worded: \"That this House has no confidence in Her Majesty\\'s Government.\" If a majority of MPs vote for the motion then it starts a 14-day countdown. If during that time the current government or any other alternative government cannot win a new vote of confidence, then an early general election would be called. That election cannot happen for at least 25 working days. The European Court of Justice has ruled that it would be legal for the UK to unilaterally revoke Article 50 to cancel Brexit (without the need for agreement from the other 27 EU countries). With the government still committed to Brexit, it\\'s very likely that a major event such as a further referendum or change of government would have to happen before such a move. It\\'s not totally clear what the process would be. But an act of Parliament calling for Article 50 to be revoked would probably be sufficient. Theresa May has said she will step down if her deal is passed. Having already survived a challenge to her leadership, there is no way she can be forced out by her party until December - under the Conservative Party rules. But she could still choose to resign if she can\\'t get her deal through and she\\'s not prepared to change course. That would trigger a Conservative leadership campaign which would result in the appointment of a new prime minister. She might also come under pressure to resign if MPs pass a \"censure motion\" - that would be a bit like a no-confidence vote but without the same automatic consequences. Again this could lead to a change in prime minister or even a change in government. Whoever ended up in charge would still face the same basic range of Brexit options though.

The extension to 31 October gives them more time to make the case for a so-called People\\'s Vote. But if a referendum is to be held between now and then, they need to win the argument fast. Within a few weeks, the Halloween deadline - already challenging - would become a nightmare to meet. That is not to say there cannot be another referendum; just that such a vote may require more time. A further UK request to EU leaders to extend the Brexit process under Article 50 could be put to their June summit and may well be approved. Without that, the six-month period that has already been granted provides minimal time to organise a referendum that meets established standards. The watchdog for referendums and elections, the Electoral Commission, is not keen on rushing these things. \"We have recommended that legislation should be in place six months before referendum polling day,\" the commission told BBC Scotland. \"This would provide enough time for electoral administrators to plan and for campaigners to make their arguments to voters.\" For that test to be met, the legislation for another EU vote by October would already need to have completed its passage through Parliament. It is, of course, for the UK government and MPs rather than the watchdog to decide. The commission\\'s head, Bob Posner, has said his team would work with MPs to deliver a referendum in the \"tightest possible timescale\". By side-stepping commission recommendations and speeding up the law-making process it is possible to organise a referendum more quickly. Academics at University College London\\'s Constitution Unit concluded that the minimum time required would be 22 weeks. They argued that shortening the timescale further would raise questions about the legitimacy of the referendum. They also acknowledged that the process could take longer where there is significant dispute in parliament, which happens to be the prevailing climate. It is also the case that the Electoral Commission wants to toughen the rules for any further referendum, rather than cutting and pasting from 2016. The commission said it had made recommendations designed \"to ensure there\\'s greater transparency for voters when it comes to digital campaigning, more real-time reporting of spending and an increase in the sanctions we can issue. \"If there is to be legislation for a referendum, we would want to work with parliamentarians to see these changes made\", the Commission said. Despite these complicating factors, let\\'s take 22 weeks as a guide. If the vote was held on the last Thursday before exit day - 24 October 2019 - that would require the legislation to be introduced to parliament by 23 May. (By coincidence, 23 May is the date pencilled in for the European Parliament elections in the UK). This timetable would require MPs to sit into August - two or three weeks after they might normally expect to break for summer. It would mean the referendum campaign clashing with the party conference season. It would also leave less than a week to act on the referendum outcome. Time enough to cancel Brexit if the decision was to remain in the EU. Not much time for the UK and European parliaments to ratify a Brexit deal should the referendum endorse the terms of departure. Please upgrade your browser Use the list below or select a button Above all, this timetable suggests referendum supporters have exactly one month to persuade the UK government of their case after parliament resumes on 23 April. In reality, it is probably less than that because there would need to be some time for officials to draft the referendum bill. The legislation for the 2016 vote would be a useful starting point but there would need to be changes. The 2016 question, for instance, would probably need to be different. Then, voters were asked: \"Should the United Kingdom remain a member of the European Union or leave the European Union?\" Presumably a future question would need to reference the Withdrawal Agreement Theresa May has negotiated with the EU. It might also need to reference the Political Declaration on the proposed future relationship, which may be subject to change in the coming months. There are certainly those who want to test public support for this package against remaining in the EU on existing terms. Others would want leaving the EU without a deal and trading on World Trade Organisation terms on the ballot paper. Others would prefer a multi-option vote. Even agreeing the basics could take more time than a tight referendum timetable would allow. If the process was speeded up further, corners would need to be cut. That would mean less time for parliamentary scrutiny and less time for the Electoral Commission to test the intelligibility of the question or decide on official campaign groups. Those advising the People\\'s Vote campaign acknowledge that \"no-one would want any of these stages unduly rushed\". However, politicians who champion putting the Brexit question back to the public are confident it can be done before the end of October. In the Commons, the SNP\\'s Westminster leader, Ian Blackford, described lack of time as a \"ridiculous excuse\". He cited the speed with which the referendum on Scottish devolution was held after the 1997 general election. That referendum took place just nineteen weeks after Tony Blair won power. But the circumstances were quite different. Then, the Labour government had won a landslide and the referendum had been a manifesto commitment. Today, Theresa May does not have a Conservative majority in the Commons and both the Tories and Labour are deeply divided on Brexit. The devolution vote also took place a few years before the creation of the Electoral Commission and new campaign standards. The prime minister has said she believes it is important to deliver on the result of the first vote. Talks between her government and the Labour Party to search for a Brexit compromise are continuing. Labour retains a public vote (another referendum) on its list of Brexit possibilities but has not made it a red line in negotiations. The idea of another referendum has not yet secured a majority in parliament. It was defeated by 280 to 292 when MPs last voted on Brexit options. It would have had a simple majority if all Labour MPs had followed party instructions to vote for it. Even a couple of SNP MPs have - so far - withheld support. There may be further opportunities for parliamentary debate and it would not take many MPs to switch sides for a majority to be achieved. Even then, there is no guarantee the prime minister would throw government weight behind a referendum and risk deepening divisions in the Conservative party. With political will, of course, anything is possible and a parliamentary majority for another referendum on an accelerated timetable may yet emerge. Unless that shift in Brexit politics comes within a matter of weeks, another referendum - if it is to happen - would almost certainly require more time.'}, {'date': '2019-04-18', 'title': 'Brexit: No deal means hard Irish border, says Selmayr', 'content': 'One of the European Commission\\'s most powerful officials has said that a no-deal Brexit would mean a hard Irish border. The comments from Martin Selmayr feature in a documentary made by ARTE, the Franco-German broadcaster. The secretary-general of the European Commission was filmed in a meeting with senior MEPs in late 2018. \"Let\\'s be very clear - if there is no withdrawal agreement there will be a hard border,\" he told them. \"This is the worst of all scenarios. \"So for Ireland this situation would be very tough and that\\'s why we need to do everything to prevent that.\" Mr Selmayr was previously chief of staff to Jean-Claude Juncker, the president of the European Commission.

The ARTE documentary The Clock Is Ticking had extensive behind the scenes access to the EU\\'s chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier and other senior EU figures. In January, the European Commission\\'s chief spokesman said it was \"obvious\" there would be a hard border in Ireland in the event of a no-deal Brexit. At that time the Irish government had repeated its stance that it would \"not accept a hard border on this island\". Since Mr Selmayr\\'s comments the EU has intensified its no deal planning. Officials have made clear that no deal would mean checks on goods moving from NI to the Republic. However the question of where and how those checks would take place remains open. The Taoiseach has said customs processes could take place away from the border but animals and food products present a more difficult challenge. The EU has strict rules for these products meaning they must be physically checked at a border inspection post.'}, {'date': '2019-05-04', 'title': \"Ruth's return\", 'content': 'A curious event, the Scottish Conservative conference in Aberdeen. Overtly courageous, rather than truly confident. It was as if every time the representatives rose to their feet to applaud their elected tribunes, their brain kicked in with a reminder of Brexit. And, somehow, the applause was instantly damped or deflated. But Ruth Davidson was, as is so often the case, the exception. Here, the applause was prolonged and enthusiastic. Why? In essence, she side-stepped, quite deliberately, the key and chronic challenges confronting her party. On Brexit, she said, in sum, \"gonnae just sort it - via those talks with Labour. Take the message from the voters, tell the European Reform Group to go chase themselves - and cut a deal with the Opposition.\" David Mundell, the Scottish Secretary, made the same point vigorously on the BBC Scotland live programme. The ERG wouldn\\'t vote for the PM\\'s deal so she was entirely right to seek a cross-party  deal, however much some Tories may scream. But is the message from the English local elections quite as simple as Ms Davidson made out? Yes, the Tories went down, sharply. Yes, Labour - still equivocating somewhat on Brexit - went down too. Yet the big winners included the Liberal Democrats - whose every utterance includes a demand for a further EU referendum to reverse Brexit. Is that not a sign of support for the concept of that second ballot? I guess Ruth Davidson looks at it primarily through the prism of the Conservative out-turn. Voters felt hurt, they punished the Tories. And the Tories, according to Ms Davidson, require to respond by getting Brexit off the agenda. But she didn\\'t labour the point. Ditto the European Elections. Rather amusing overnight tales told of disclosures from Ms Davidson\\'s speech rehearsals. Her apparent disquiet about dealing with those elections scheduled, currently, for the 23rd of May. After a light-hearted reference to the leak - she satirically blamed her offspring, Finn - Ms Davidson made but a single comment about the impending elections. Was it an appeal to vote Tory? An appeal to activists to pound the streets and stamp the envelopes? Friends, it was not. It was a cursory warning that the Euro Elections could be even worse for the Tories than the English locals. So did she focus then on the union, on the United Kingdom? Well, yes and no. She stated, repeatedly, that she backed the existence of the UK. She lampooned Nicola Sturgeon\\'s repeated demands for a rerun referendum. She noted, again, that Westminster would not sanction an official referendum before the next Holyrood elections in 2021 (and the first minister, we know, wouldn\\'t assay any other kind.) But the Tory leader tried to move beyond the issue of choosing Scotland in the union - to the question of making choices within Scotland. Inevitably, the policy announcements were mainly headlines, rather than detail at this stage. But it was a comprehensive package nevertheless. Economic growth, green energy, skills and vocational training. As I discussed with guests on the live programme, there was little mention of the detailed taxation plans which would accompany this policy programme. Would the Conservatives move from their current opposition to the Scottish government\\'s tax structure? Expect rival parties to pose that question too, vigorously. But this was a deliberate attempt by Ms Davidson to move beyond simply endorsing the union to arguing what Tories might do, were they in a position to wield power in Scotland. It builds upon the strategy she envisaged after the last Holyrood elections when the Tories contrived to build relative success upon a staunch defence of the union. They were able, at that time, to corral pro-union votes into their camp - and to gain, as a result. Ms Davidson\\'s aim, deflected by the Brexit bourach, has been to construct a Conservative offer in Scotland that enables them to attract voters beyond that Unionist core. She is saying, in essence:  yes, we are the party of the union.  We think you, the voters, get that concept and we thank you for that. But have you had a glance at our policies on, say, the economy and education? Might you like those policies put into practice? There are, of course, umpteen obstacles in the way. Right now, the Tories are going down in the popularity ranks, not up. Secondly, it is rather a long time since they topped the popularity stakes in Scotland. The SNP and the others would have a verdict to offer on that. Thirdly, Holyrood\\'s proportional voting system was deliberately designed to prevent one party - Labour had the SNP in mind - winning a majority of seats on a minority of votes. So - with the exception of 2011 - we have had coalition administrations or minority government. I doubt whether any party would coalesce with the Tories, or whether they would collectively permit them to govern without persistent opposition. But, hey, those decisions are for the voters. Ruth Davidson can do no more than state her case, both in terms of strategy and policy. Today, she did so, rather vigorously. It helped her party members forget their pain.

Edinburgh Airport chief executive Gordon Dewar said he was expecting a solid summer, but insisted the Scottish government must cut air passenger duty. He also said certainty over the UK\\'s deal for leaving the EU was needed so airlines could invest confidently. Government plans to cut air passenger duty have been hit by legal issues. Scottish ministers want to replace the tax with an alternative, then cut it by 50%, before eventually scrapping it completely. But in 2017, they said plans to continue exempting journeys from airports in the Highlands and Islands required EU approval under state aid rules. Edinburgh Airport has just announced that one million passengers went through the terminal last month - a first for the month of March. Mr Dewar told the BBC\\'s Radio\\'s Good Morning Scotland programme: \"We\\'ve got particular issues in the UK with all of the uncertainty around Brexit and on top of that we\\'ve got the highest taxation anywhere in the world. \"What we\\'re hearing from airlines is that, as belts need to be tightened, Scotland and the UK in general are probably going to suffer more than most. \"While we\\'re bucking the trend at the moment, it\\'s not a comfortable place to be. \"It\\'s really important the Scottish government fulfils the promise they made a few years ago about reducing that tax or we will see more reductions, as we\\'ve already seen in other airports around Scotland and indeed a couple of routes ourselves, where APD has driven airliners out of the market.\" Mr Dewar added: \"The trouble is, it was promised as though it were imminent four or five years ago and airlines like Norwegian and Ryanair invested very heavily in putting new capacity into the market then. \"Because it\\'s not happened and because they\\'re not confident it\\'s ever going to happen, they\\'re now taking it away.\" On Brexit, Mr Dewar welcomed the deal meaning there will be no new restrictions on flying in the EU after the UK leaves. But he added: \"What\\'s less certain is what\\'s going to happen with the wider economy. \"I think we\\'re going to have a solid summer, but uncertainty - both in consumer confidence and in airline investment decisions - can\\'t be helpful  and we just need to get clarity as quickly as possible.\" A statement from the Scottish government explained that work was ongoing to find a solution in regard to the Highlands and Islands exemption. It explained: \"This is crucial to ensure the devolved powers are not compromised, and we continue to work with the UK government to find a solution. \"While UK Air Passenger Duty continues to operate in Scotland, we call on the UK government to act now and reduce APD rates to support connectivity and economic growth across the UK.\" For the latest business news as it happens, follow BBC presenter Andrew Black\\'s updates each weekday morning on BBC Radio Scotland\\'s Good Morning Scotland programme between 0600 and 0900.'}, {'date': '2019-04-17', 'title': 'Brexit: Coveney in pledge on European health insurance cards', 'content': 'The Irish government has said it is willing to cover the cost of European Health Insurance Cards (EHIC) for all citizens in NI after a no-deal Brexit. Tanaiste (Irish deputy PM) Simon Coveney said this would cost up to 4m euros (£3.46m). He said the cards would be available to everyone in Northern Ireland, not just those who hold an Irish passport. Mr Coveney was speaking during a visit to Downpatrick on Wednesday. The EHIC currently entitles UK citizens to state-provided medical treatment if they fall ill or have an accident in EU or EFTA-member countries. If the UK leaves with no deal, EHICs issued in the UK will not be valid. Mr Coveney said this was a \"contingency plan\" in the event of a no-deal Brexit. \"We want to try to extend those privileges to everybody in Northern Ireland,\" he said. \"That is something we would try to progress on the basis of residency in Northern Ireland as opposed to whether you hold a British or Irish passport which, of course, is a sensitive thing linked to people\\'s background and identity.\" Taoiseach Leo Varadkar previously said he wanted it to be retained post-Brexit for people in Northern Ireland. The UK is trying to reach agreements with EU governments to extend the reciprocal health care arrangements. Mr Coveney said the Irish government was working to ensure it could be extended for people in Northern Ireland and added that because they would no longer be resident in the EU, it would \"pose challenges\". He also said it would mean having to pass legislation in the Dail. \"When EU citizens travel across the EU they have health insurance cover,\" Mr Coveney said. \"We are working and will ensure that we extend that right to Northern Ireland \"That will involve passing legislation here and it will involve the Irish government if necessary paying for that insurance cover for citizens in Northern Ireland.\" He added that he wanted to ensure citizens in Northern Ireland could continue to access the Erasmus programmes after Brexit. The Erasmus scheme is an EU programme that helps students study in other countries. The tanaiste said that he recognised the uncertainty about Brexit had caused concern about future arrangements, but that nothing changed the position that Irish citizens in Northern Ireland \"continue to be EU citizens\". Anyone born in Northern Ireland has the right to identify as Irish or British or both, thanks to the Good Friday Agreement, a peace deal signed in April 1998 by the British and Irish governments and Northern Ireland\\'s political parties. In a statement, the Irish Department of Foreign Affairs said that \"in order to fully uphold the spirit of the Good Friday Agreement, where issues arise with the UK exit from the EU, these should be addressed in a way that avoids any difference in entitlements based on citizenship in Northern Ireland\".'}, {'date': '2019-04-16', 'title': \"Brexit: Environmental rules in Northern Ireland 'at risk'\", 'content': 'Environmentalists fear Northern Ireland could be left behind when it comes to protecting important species and habitats after Brexit. Much of the current protection is based on EU law, backed up by the threat of fines from a European court. But after Brexit, that oversight will be lost. And with no Northern Ireland Assembly to legislate on replacing it, experts claim governance gaps could open up. EU directives are given legal effect by domestic legislation, which will continue to apply. Civil servants have taken an option to extend some English laws to Northern Ireland and say existing protections will not be undermined. But environmentalists\\' concerns remain, especially when it comes to cross-border EU protected sites and issues like water and air quality. Nature Matters NI is an umbrella for groups like the National Trust, RSPB and Ulster Wildlife which have come together to campaign for a green Brexit. Spokesperson Emily Hunter said there was already \"weak\" environmental governance in Northern Ireland. \"We\\'re the only part of the UK that doesn\\'t have an independent environmental protection agency but we don\\'t have a government to put anything in place to replace what we\\'re losing from the EU,\" she said. \"So we\\'re in a position where we could easily fall behind the rest of the UK.\" Slieve Beagh is a huge area of upland blanket bog straddling counties Monaghan, Tyrone and Fermanagh. An important EU protected habitat in its own right, it is also a stronghold for the hen harrier, a scarce bird of prey. At present, it is covered by an EU-funded conservation project. Ecologist Rory Sheehan helps manage it. He said there was great commitment to the area and its wildlife and, with EU directives transposed into domestic legislation on both sides of the border, he is confident protection that will not be diluted. But he is concerned about funding and whether colleagues in Northern Ireland will continue to be able to draw down EU Peace money in future. The signs are positive, but the details are still to be worked out. Dr Viviane Gravey lectures in European politics in Queen\\'s University and specialises in agriculture and environmental policy. She cites cross-border dumping of waste as an example of how UK and Irish membership of the EU worked. It helped in the repatriation of large quantities of domestic rubbish from illegal landfills in Northern Ireland back to the Republic of Ireland, where it came from. \"There was a mechanism there to deal with that and ensure that Ireland would pay most of the cost of repatriating that waste,\" she said. \"Sometimes shared rules mean that you don\\'t have any problems arising, but it also means that you have common ways of dealing with a problem and there\\'s a procedure in place, and that what\\'s we risk losing.\" Dr Gravey said the absence of an assembly was a stumbling block to the establishment of effective environmental governance post Brexit. There are lots of \"interesting discussions\" going on in the rest of the UK about what will replace EU oversight, but in Northern Ireland, those talks are not happening. She said that in a region where there had traditionally been less importance attached to environmental protection by politicians, there is no guarantee that a future environment minister would adopt robust policies. Academics have also raised concerns about the amount of power that Northern Ireland\\'s Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs (Daera) will have to interpret conservation laws after Brexit. A paper by Dr Ciara Brennan from Newcastle University and Dr Mary Dobbs from Queen\\'s University points out that where big infrastructure projects affect protected sites, Daera will be responsible for advising on whether there is an \"overriding public interest\" in proceeding. That would replace the role currently undertaken by the European Commission. The academics suggest planning officials in infrastructure would be asking approval from colleagues in Daera, a situation which, they claim, could lead to \"conflicts of interest\" where \"the government is seeking approval from itself\".

That\\'s six months of can-kicking-down-road opportunities. It gives us the summer months to puzzle over the constitutional contradiction of a prime minister who agrees to be forced from office if she successfully gets her deal through, but won\\'t leave if she fails. The message from business is fairly uniform: Phew! Now get your act together, politicians. We don\\'t want to be in this position in October, and the damage is already being done. Through much of the Brexit saga, business has been politely respectful of the democratic process. Partly, it\\'s because of the misplaced expectation, also to be found elsewhere at home and abroad, that Britain would return to its characteristic pragmatism and flexibility and something sensible would be worked out in the end. For many in business, the mindset is about seeking out opportunities, whatever the political context. They don\\'t want to alienate customers by taking sides on a highly divisive issue. And business thinks in terms of keeping doors open to the corridors of power. But getting access to power doesn\\'t count for much when most who have worked with Theresa May say that she is unyielding in her views, and gives you little sense of whether she understands what you\\'re trying to say. So the business lobbies\\' polite respect for democracy has reached its limits, when the process is mired in crisis; a prime minister whose cabinet is openly split, and who cannot get her key policy through the House of Commons, who is protected by the combination of a further eight-month ban on internal party challenges, her party\\'s fear of precipitating a general election and the lack of appetite for a leadership contest for now. Meanwhile, she remains resolutely stuck on getting her deal approved. To this, add a national election for MEPs, for which no-one was prepared, for which Conservative and Labour parties have neither clear nor unifying messages, motivated activists, campaign funds or even candidates selected. It\\'s a political environment in which populist voices can run riot. Hence, the messaging from business lobbies on the morning after the summit night before is a loud reminder that nothing has been resolved. Exactly the same problems persist, and unless something is done to resolve the crisis, we\\'ll reach the new Halloween departure date, and be back on the same scary \\'no deal\\' cliff-edge. Emboldened by the damage already being done to businesses - investment stalled, contracts delayed, some jobs lost (though not many, it seems) - the business lobby groups are talking about revoking Article 50 or about another referendum. So, to venture into constitutional politics, let\\'s look at those options. Those who oppose remaining in the European Union, following the 2016 referendum result, talk darkly of forces being unleashed that the ruling class won\\'t like. There is implicit, and apparently genuine fear of the mob. Either it is seen storming down Whitehall to the House of Commons, wielding pitchforks or worse, or it will show its anger at the ballot box, turning to populists and demagogues who wield simplistic or extreme solutions. The message: \\'if you thought that red bus with the NHS slogan was bad, you ain\\'t seen nothin\\' yet.\\' The other side of this gets less attention - what if Remainers got their way? (Let\\'s assume that those who want another referendum also want it to result in a \\'Remain\\' majority -  though don\\'t forget that many who would prefer to remain are unpersuaded of the referendum option, as they fear it could repeat \\'Leave\\', or be as close and divisive as 2016.) I was at Westminster last month on the same day of the vast march calling for another referendum. It struck me that marchers were from a narrow range of Remain stereotypes - notably ageing liberals and students. I wasn\\'t seeing much evidence of people marching to complain that they had been misled into voting Leave and wanted a chance to vote the opposite way. That\\'s what the polls also tell us. What I also noted was that the message was a narrow one. Understandably, it focussed on the spectacular burach that Theresa May and her government have made of the Brexit process. If judging a march by its placards, this is focussed on the personalities of Tory politicians, sometimes abusively, with a large dose of British irony.  In answer to Theresa May\\'s version of the Iron Lady, this was the ironic lady. The easy, unifying message for Remainers is that Leavers got us into this mess, and seem incapable of finding a way out, so - as the main slogan goes - let the people decide. But what if they are successful? What if there is another referendum? And what if Britain does exit the European Union - from which a campaign could quickly start to get back in? I wasn\\'t seeing banners or hearing slogans with which to win the argument decisively, or at all. I could see many European flags, of course. The TV broadcasts from Westminster\\'s College Green are festooned with the blue and stars. During 45 years of membership, these were rarely waved with any pride by British people. Now a rallying standard, the EU flag seems more likely to be a turn-off or a provocation than an appeal to those who may be wavering in the centre ground on this debate. Somehow, the pro-Europe side of the debate needs to make EU membership the patriotic thing to do for Union Flag wavers, and Saltires in Scotland, with a message aimed at the centre ground of persuadables - the message that the David Cameron campaign failed to articulate in 2016. That would have to counter Brexiteers\\' simple arguments that Britain lacks control of its destiny while part of the European Union. It would have to explain why it sees European membership as being in Britain\\'s interests, without mind-numbing references to co-decision between Parliament and Council, using the Qualified Majority Voting system. \"You\\'re better off in Europe\" might work, but it doesn\\'t feel that way to many voters who are not feeling better off. They tend not to trust an economist bearing a counter-factual. They\\'re feeling a squeeze on household budgets over the past decade and they\\'re feeling peeved off. Perhaps it needs broken down, in tribute to that Life of Brian discussion of \"what the Romans have ever done for us\"; olive oil, a plentiful choice of cheese, no more roaming charges, cheap flights and pet passports. (It\\'s quite a middle class list!) How about the scale of market that brings Japanese car manufacturers to Britain\\'s shores? Being part of Europe has brought jobs. And when in Rome... ordering a pizza, you can be reassured there\\'s a minimum standard for food safety, worker protection for restaurant staff, mutual respect of legal rights and contracts, (getting a bit wonkish already, you see?) and the right to stay, work and invest there if you fancy opening your own pizzeria. Given another referendum, Remainers could look to a greater public understanding of the benefits brought to Britain by immigration. People are much clearer now how much business, including agriculture, and the NHS, rely on staffing from across the EU. But that doesn\\'t mean hostility to immigration, or simply concern about it, has gone away. It still has to be addressed. It can still be ruthlessly exploited. And then, how about the slogan \"peace in our time\"? OK, so it didn\\'t work well for Neville Chamberlain. But it is perhaps the greatest historical achievement of the EU. It has lost traction with younger generations, across Europe, who take the continent\\'s peace for granted. On the subject of the views across Europe, there\\'s another side to this, to be found on the other side of the EU table. For now, the leaders of the EU 27 are willing to let Britain remain. They don\\'t want to be seen to be kicking Britain out. But patience has, understandably, been wearing thin. Particularly in France, Emmanuel Macron is voicing frustration about Britain continuing to disrupt the rest of the Union. He has a difficult European Parliament election to fight. Nigel Farage on the rampage wouldn\\'t help, less still a Tory MP with the unlikely name of Mark Francois. A continental take on the late-night discussions over Brexit is that the most significant element was the disagreement between France and Germany. Brexit strains are telling on the Paris-Berlin motor that has long powered the EU project. If Britain were to find a way to reverse the Brexit decision - through revocation or a referendum - the UK can expect to retain its special deals: the budget rebate, and on being allowed to remain outside the euro currency and of the Schengen-free travel area. But a renewed membership of the EU club would come with expectations that Britain properly and permanently commits - if not to the full-blooded project of \"an ever closer union\", at least to playing a constructive role in future developments. Don\\'t hold your breath for this, but its political leaders could be expected by others to better explain and support decisions of the Council of Ministers and the European Court of Justice. For Britain to be a settled member, it would need a political discourse, to be found in many European countries and also in Scotland, which combines two or more political identities, and which accepts that membership of the club is compatible with sovereignty, that national interest lies in being within the club, and its compromises are necessary to pursue combined national and collective interests. Symbolically, a Britain remaining in Europe would have to fly the flags with equal status. Outside Holyrood since the Parliament building was opened, the three flags of Scotland, the UK and Europe have flown at the same height. Even among those who support Britain having a place in Europe, we seem a long way from accepting multiple identities in the official flags which fly above the Houses of Parliament. But for the settled will of the British people to be within Europe, that is a symbolic representation of what would be needed.'}, {'date': '2019-04-06', 'title': \"Brexit: Hammond 'optimistic' over Brexit talks with Labour\", 'content': 'Chancellor Philip Hammond has said he is \"optimistic\" Brexit discussions between the government and Labour can reach \"some form of agreement\". Mr Hammond said there were \"no red lines\" in the meetings. But Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said he was \"waiting to see the red lines move\" and had not \"noticed any great change in the government\\'s position\". Three days of talks ended on Friday without agreement and Labour said no more talks were planned this weekend. Downing Street responded by saying it was prepared to pursue alterations to the deal and ready to hold further discussions with Labour over the weekend. The talks have been taking place to try to find a proposal to put to MPs which could break the Brexit deadlock in the Commons before an emergency EU summit on Wednesday. Speaking ahead of an EU finance ministers\\' meeting in Bucharest, Mr Hammond told reporters: \"We are expecting to exchange some more text with the Labour Party today, so this is an ongoing process.\" Mr Hammond said: \"We should complete the process in Parliament... Some people in the Labour Party are making other suggestions to us. Of course, we have to be prepared to discuss them. \"Our approach to these discussions with Labour is we have no red lines.

Mr Corbyn told the BBC: \"We have a party position on the future relationship with Europe... and we will responsibly discharge those duties, but we are determined to make sure there is no crashing out.\" The prime minister has been unable to get Parliamentary backing for the withdrawal agreement she secured with the EU in November last year, which sets out the terms of the UK\\'s departure. Labour has said it wants fundamental changes to a document drawn up at the same time, known as the political declaration. It sets out ambitions for the future relationship between the UK and EU after Brexit - including on trade, regulations, security and fishing rights - but does not legally commit either party. Shadow home secretary Ms Abbott told BBC Radio 4\\'s Today programme that Labour had engaged in the talks \"in good faith\" and shadow Brexit minister Sir Keir Starmer had written to the government to say he wants them to continue. She said there was concern that the government has made \"no movement\" on altering the political declaration and \"that is key\". A Downing Street spokesman said after Friday\\'s talks that \"serious proposals\" were made and it was \"prepared to pursue changes to the political declaration in order to deliver a deal that is acceptable to both sides\". BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg says there was a sense that the government has \"only offered clarifications on what might be possible from the existing documents, rather than adjusting any of their actual proposals\". She added that both sides agreed the talks are not yet over, but there were no firm commitments for when further discussions might take place. The UK is due to leave the EU on 12 April and, as yet, no withdrawal deal has been approved by the House of Commons. Prime Minister Theresa May has written to European Council President Donald Tusk to request an extension to the Brexit process until 30 June but says if MPs agree a deal, the UK should be able to leave before European parliamentary elections are held on 23 May. She says the UK would prepare to field candidates in May\\'s European Parliament elections if MPs failed to back a deal. But education minister Nadhim Zahawi told the Today programme it would be \"a suicide note of the Conservative Party if we had to fight the European elections\". He added the elections would pose an \"existential threat\" to both the Conservatives and Labour if they \"haven\\'t been able to deliver Brexit\". Mr Zahawi suggested that if an agreement could not be found from the talks with Labour, MPs should be asked to find a compromise on a deal through a preferential voting system.

French Europe minister Amelie de Montchalin said such a delay would require the UK to put forward a proposal with \"clear and credible political backing\". \"In the absence of such a plan, we would have to acknowledge that the UK chose to leave the EU in a disorderly manner,\" she added. Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar told RTE it was unlikely that a UK request for a delay would be vetoed by any EU member nations as it could cause economic hardship in the bloc and \"they wouldn\\'t be forgiven for it\".

EU leaders have agreed to delay the UK\\'s departure date from 12 April to 31 October, to avoid a no-deal Brexit.

This would avoid the UK having to take part in European Parliament elections, currently scheduled for 23 May. The UK was originally due to leave the EU on 29 March, but its departure date has been delayed twice, after the Commons rejected the withdrawal deal negotiated with the EU by large margins. The meeting between Mr McDonnell, members of Jeremy Corbyn\\'s staff and Mr Gove and Mr Lidington lasted just over an hour.

But he said the two sides were still some way apart on customs arrangements. Labour wants a new permanent customs union with the EU, which would allow tariff-free trade in goods. The government has repeatedly ruled out remaining in the EU\\'s customs union, arguing it would prevent the UK from setting its own trade policy. Under EU rules, the UK will have to hold European Parliament elections in May, or face leaving on 1 June without a deal.

A government source said \"plans will evolve and adapt\", but would not stop while the chance of leaving the EU without an agreement remained. The source said that a leaked message which reportedly referred to the \"winding down\" of no-deal preparation related only to Operation Yellowhammer - the contingency planning programme based on worst-case scenarios - and not no-deal planning in general.

Both Jen and Dorothy have lived with leg issues, but Anna was fortunate that her hospital stay rid of her polio entirely.

Soldier F is a former British soldier facing murder charges over the killing of two people on Bloody Sunday in Londonderry in 1972. The Public Prosecution Service said there was enough evidence to prosecute Soldier F for the murders of James Wray and William McKinney. A war of words has broken out between republicans and unionists over the banner. The Department for Infrastructure said it did not give permission for the banner and does not condone putting it up. The PSNI said it is aware of the banner and is investigating. Meanwhile, a £40,000 party has caused consternation in County Armagh.

The most powerful US Democrat, Nancy Pelosi, visited the border and delivered a stark message. If the UK\\'s manner of leaving the EU damages the Good Friday Agreement then forget about a US-UK trade deal. \"That\\'s just not on the cards if there\\'s any harm done to the Good Friday accords,\" she said. The Irish government is clear that any hardening of the border would amount to harm. The text of the agreement has little to say about border arrangements but Irish ministers say a harder border would certainly damage the spirit of the agreement. Mrs Pelosi seems to be on board with that definition. She told an audience at the London School of Economics: \"This is not a treaty only, it\\'s an ideal, it\\'s a value, it\\'s something that is a model to the world.\" So this was a message to some Brexiteers: if the Irish government is not happy, we will block a trade deal. A US deal is perhaps the ultimate prize for the free-trading, \\'Global Britain\\' branch of the Brexit movement. It would demonstrate that Brexit was worthwhile, that it allowed the UK to land big deals as an independent trading nation. Some of these people also believe that the border issue is largely concocted and that leaving the EU without a deal would not be a problem. Mrs Pelosi personally took issue with this notion. She had a reportedly stormy meeting with members of the pro-Brexit European Research Group of MPs. There was also a less high-profile visitor in Northern Ireland this week but she also came with an important message. Karen Wheeler, a senior HMRC official, addressed a Brexit conference in Belfast which had been organised by InterTrade Ireland and other business groups. Ms Wheeler is director general for Border Co-ordination, a cross-government role concerning everything to do with Brexit and borders. For some Brexit supporters the solution to the Irish border lies in technology. That is mainly about the tracking and monitoring of freight which could allow the UK to leave the EU\\'s regulatory orbit but also avoid new checks at the border. Ms Wheeler was asked what work HMRC had been doing to find technological solutions for the border. Her reply betrayed a certain scepticism. She agreed that there is technology which provides for a certain level of automated customs processing or tracking of goods. But she added: \"They are not all instantly available. \"Many of them would take years to implement and there is no border in the world which has a full package of all of these technologies. \"There is no such thing in the world at the moment at a land border which doesn\\'t have queues and processes and technologies. \"It may be that over a number of years more of those technologies will emerge. But some of those things are quite hard to avoid.\" The idea that any technological solution would be years away also surfaced in a Home Office document seen by the Daily Telegraph and Sky News. The work from the Home Office Policy Unit described a confection of technologies which would not be operational until 2030. It also points out that for any technological solution to work it would require \"agreement and commitment\" from the Republic of Ireland. So ultimately the border issue comes back to politics and diplomacy.'}, {'date': '2019-05-04', 'title': \"Newspaper headlines: 'Shattered Tories' and 'new Maddie suspect'\", 'content': 'The local election results in England make the lead for most papers. The Telegraph says voters delivered a two-fingered salute to the main parties. For the Politico website, this was the ultimate protest vote - and shows that things are far from business as usual. The Express says voters vented their anger at the ballot box and sent one clear demand to politicians - deliver Brexit. \"So NOW will they listen?\" the Mail\\'s headline asks. According to the paper, returning officers reported that at least 30,000 ballot papers were spoiled with scrawled messages about Brexit in protest at the parliamentary \"shambles\".

But the Express tells its readers not to be fooled by the gains of the Liberal Democrats.

He told the BBC they had a \"fair bit in common\" over future customs objectives but further compromise was needed. While there was no deadline, he said the sides would \"take stock\" in 10 days and the process could not drag out. But former Conservative leader Iain Duncan Smith said the process was a \"recipe for disaster\" for his party. He called for Prime Minister Theresa May to make way for a new Conservative leader next month - but Mr Lidington insisted replacing the prime minister would \"not change the arithmetic in Parliament\". Talks between the government and Labour are set to continue over the Easter parliamentary recess in the hope of finding a Brexit agreement that will be acceptable to MPs. A series of working groups in key areas, such as environmental standards, security and workers\\' rights, have been set up to try and find common ground. The EU has insisted the terms of the UK\\'s withdrawal, rejected three times by MPs, cannot be renegotiated - but there is scope to strengthen the political declaration, a document setting out the parameters of the UK\\'s future relations with the EU, ahead of the new Brexit deadline of 31 October. Mr Lidington, who is regarded as Mrs May\\'s de facto deputy, said he had not set a deadline for the talks to produce a result but the public wanted Parliament to resolve their differences quickly. \"I don\\'t think the question can be allowed to drag out for much longer,\" he said. Asked whether the government could drop its opposition to a customs union with the EU, as demanded by Labour, Mr Lidington said both sides had well-known \"public positions\". He suggested the two sides were considering whether there was a \"mechanism\" to deliver the benefits of a customs union, such as tariff and quota-free trade with the EU, while also enabling the UK to have an independent trade policy and input into EU agreements affecting the UK. \"What we have found in terms of objectives… there is a fair bit that both parties would have in common,\" he said. \"If we are going to find an agreement there needs to be movement on both sides. \"I don\\'t want to compromise what is at the moment a space where we are testing with the opposition, and they are testing with us, particular ways in which we could move forward.\" But Mr Duncan Smith warned against his party embracing Labour\\'s Brexit policy, telling Sky\\'s Sophy Ridge on Sunday that he had \"real concerns with some of my colleagues going out lauding Jeremy Corbyn\". \"We need to be very clear in the course of this that we don\\'t end up letting Jeremy Corbyn dictate to us that we stay in a customs union, or we have some kind of second referendum, or stay aligned with the European single market - all of that given to us by Jeremy Corbyn is a recipe for disaster.\" He said there was real grassroots anger at the prospect of the Conservatives having to fight European elections at the end of May and the prime minister should leave Downing Street this summer irrespective of whether the withdrawal agreement had been approved or not. \"She said she would go as and when the agreement was ratified, which was looking at around about May, June. I think those dates still stand,\" he said. But Labour\\'s shadow transport Secretary Andy McDonald said the talks would \"count for nothing\" if the Conservatives changed leader and a hard Brexiteer took over from Mrs May. Meanwhile, Jeremy Corbyn has been warned Labour will \"haemorrhage\" votes in the EU election unless the party explicitly backs a further referendum. MEP Richard Corbett, leader of the party in the EU Parliament, told the Observer Labour risked losing out to parties committed to a public vote. \"If Labour does not re-confirm its support for a confirmatory public vote on any Brexit deal in its manifesto, then it will haemorrhage votes to parties who do have a clear message,\" he said. \"If on the other hand we do offer clarity and a confirmatory ballot we could do very well.\" Labour\\'s current policy is to keep all options on the table - including pressing for a further EU referendum. Labour MP David Lammy told the BBC\\'s Andrew Marr Show that the current \"rows would continue\" unless the public had the final say on the issue.

But it\\'s what the wrangling in Brussels means for EU unity ahead of European Parliament elections next month that preoccupies many in the media. For France\\'s Le Monde, it\\'s a \"Halloween Brexit... due on 31 October, the Anglo-Saxon holiday of pumpkins and witches\". It says President Emmanuel Macron backed Prime Minister Theresa May\\'s request for a short delay until 30 June but \"was forced to compromise\". The leaders finally split the difference with a typically European compromise: \"they cut the pumpkin in half\". France\\'s Libération believes the extension came at the cost of breaking the united front of EU leaders. \"This increasingly incomprehensible waltz of dates shows that the UK has succeeded in exporting its byzantine internal battles to Brussels. For this summit broke to pieces the nice, united European front which held together, for better or for worse, for three years.\" Libération says the 27 EU leaders have raised the risk of \"allowing the British to weigh in on the choice of the future presidents of the EU Commission, Parliament, European Council and the European Central Bank, as well as on discussions regarding the 2020 budget and financial prospects for 2021-2027\". \"Which is to say, they are giving London a capacity for nuisance which it could not have dared dream of.\" Germany\\'s Die Welt agrees the effect of Brexit is that \"the alliance of the 27 member states is crumbling\". \"The diverging \\'Brexit philosophy\\' in Paris and Berlin is obvious. With his hard line towards London, Macron wants to scare populists in his own country about similar anti-EU plans. Berlin, on the other hand, sees long-term damage in a lacking willingness to compromise, which could truly bring the populists onto the scene.\" In the Netherlands, Algemeen Dagblad says Europe is in a very difficult position. \"Everybody agrees that a no-deal Brexit is undesirable for all parties… The EU, facing the prospect of European parliamentary elections in May, does not want to be perceived as the bad guy dropping the UK into misery.\" Other papers take a very tough tone towards Britain. Barcelona-based La Vanguardia says: \"The extension discussed through an intense debate at an informal summit in Brussels is the second one and should be final. The British decided to leave the EU by their own volition,\" in a post-summit editorial headlined \"Brexit and the patience of the EU\". In Italy, there\\'s recognition of the EU\\'s tough choices. For Il Sole 24 Ore, \"the 27 want to rule out a dramatic, hard Brexit, but they also want to avoid Britain\\'s permanence in the Union, one foot in and the other out, impacting on European affairs\". An alternative take that cannot be allowed to slip through the net comes from Patrick Smyth in the Irish Times who warns of the very real threat of a no-eel Brexit. He\\'s talking about the transhipment of live species - in this case eels from Lough Erne in Northern Ireland - to the Republic, and the broader point of importing animal-based food products into the EU. \"It is true that the fate of the eels can be said to be small beer compared with the impact on the Irish economy of a no-deal Brexit. But it is an illustration of the breadth of the potential impact.\" While the likelihood of a no-deal Brexit may have receded, he says, \"we may well be back all too shortly facing up for real to a dreadful prospect in which, among other issues of greater import, the fate of eels and ham sandwiches will again be on the order of the day.\" BBC Monitoring reports and analyses news from TV, radio, web and print media around the world.

Prime Minister Theresa May says if a deal gets through Parliament before that date, the UK will not participate. But it seems likely that the UK will still be in the EU at that point. The European Parliament is directly elected by EU voters. It is responsible, along with the Council of Ministers from member states, for making laws and approving budgets. It also plays a role in the EU\\'s relations with other countries, including those wishing to join the bloc. Its members represent the interests of different countries and different regions within the EU. Every five years, EU countries go to the polls to elect members of the European Parliament (MEPs). Each country is allocated a set number of seats, roughly depending on the size of its population. The smallest, Malta (population: around half a million) has six members sitting in the European Parliament while the largest, Germany (population: 82 million) has 96. At the moment there are 751 MEPs in total and the UK has 73. Candidates can stand as individuals or they can stand as representatives of one of the UK\\'s political parties. Once elected, they represent different regions of the country, again according to population. The north-east of England and Northern Ireland have three MEPs each while the south-east of England, including London, has 18. While most UK MEPs are also members of a national party, once in the European Parliament they sit in one of eight political groups which include MEPs from across the EU who share the same political affiliation. Member states can run elections to the European Parliament according to their own national laws and traditions, but they must stick to some common rules. MEPs must be elected using a system of proportional representation - so, for example, a party which gains a third of the votes wins a third of the seats. Turnout in the UK for European Parliament elections is low both by EU standards and by the standards of other UK elections. The last time they were held in 2014, 36% of those eligible to vote did so, compared with 43% in the EU as a whole. That compares with 66% turnout at the following year\\'s general election. In 2016, 56% of the electorate voted in the Scottish Parliament elections, 45% in the Welsh Assembly and 54% in the Northern Ireland Assembly. In local elections in England, turnout varies depending largely on what other elections are taking place on the same day, sometimes dipping as low as the European elections turnout and sometimes rising close to the level of general elections. The last time European elections were held in 2014, the UK spent £109m on them. The main costs were running the poll itself (securing polling stations and venues to run counts) and mailing out candidate information and polling cards. The government has said that if the UK does not end up participating in the 2019 elections, it will reimburse local returning officers - the people responsible for running elections - for any expenses already paid. The EU is planning to reduce the overall number of seats in the parliament from 751 to 705 when the UK leaves. There will be a reallocation of 27 of the UK\\'s seats to 14 other member states that are currently underrepresented. And the rest will be set aside with the possibility of being allocated to any new member states that join in the future. The EU has already passed legislation to do this, but it does not take effect until the UK leaves. The number of seats is capped in law at 751. The European Commission had advised that as long as the UK made a decision to take part in the European elections by mid-April, this reallocation would be reversed. But what if the UK elects MEPs and then passes a deal to leave the EU? In that case, the UK MEPs would not take their seats, leaving vacancies. The House of Commons Library says that extra MEPs could potentially be elected on \"stand-by\" in some member states but not take up their seats until the UK leaves the EU.

It topped off a bad night in Essex for the Tories as they lost control of four other councils and saw their majority slashed at a third. The biggest shock was the loss of Uttlesford to a residents\\' association. In Chelmsford, MP Vicky Ford said national frustration with Brexit had hit the party\\'s vote locally. However, the Tories managed to retain control of six Essex councils. All 57 seat in Chelmsford were up for grabs on Thursday\\'s poll, and the Liberal Democrats gained 26, mostly at the expense of the Conservatives who lost 31. Independent candidates won five seats. At the Chelmsford count, Ms Ford became emotional as she reflected on \"a very disappointing night\". \"I think it is really disappointing when you look at some of the individuals who have lost their seats tonight - people who have worked their socks off for Chelmsford,\" she said. \"They have lost their seats as a result of what is happening nationally reflecting back in people not wanting to turn out and vote locally.\" Colchester Borough Council was in the spotlight before the elections with a coalition of Liberal Democrats, Labour and independents holding a slim majority over the Conservatives. The Tories lost two seats, including leader Darius Laws, who was beaten by Green Mark Goacher. Mr Laws said Brexit was partly to blame for the poor showing. He said: \"Brexit definitely is a contributing factor but perhaps some bigger national newspapers have wanted it to be a bigger issue [than it was]. \"It came up on the doorstep but people almost just shrugged their shoulders on it. \"I am naturally disappointed, I think I have been a competent councillor and have done some different things and taken different approaches. \"The national mood hasn\\'t helped.\" In Clacton, Tendring District Council\\'s count was delayed after 1,000 postal votes arrived on the day with 200 having inadvertently been sent to Chelmsford. The votes were sent on by express delivery and were counted. The Conservatives lost their majority at the authority, which is now under no overall control. Two seats are still up for grabs in St Osyth with the vote delayed until 23 May due to a candidate\\'s death. UKIP has lost seats in two of its strongholds. The Clacton constituency was the first to elect a UKIP MP in 2014 when sitting Conservative MP Douglas Carswell defected, stood down and won the subsequent by-election. He retained the seat in the 2015 General Election, but lost it to the Conservatives in the 2017 General Election. At Tendring District Council, UKIP had 19 councillors in 2015. They have lost 14 seats since then, and after Thursday\\'s vote, are left with five councillors. In Thurrock, UKIP lost all of its seven seats as the unitary council remained in no overall control. The only Essex council Labour had control of going into the elections was Harlow District, and the party has retained control with the same number of seats - 20 - to the Conservatives\\' 13. By BBC Look East political correspondent Andrew Sinclair It has been a bad night for the Conservatives. Not only did they fail to take control of Colchester council - their main target - their leader lost his seat to the Greens. The Tories also lost control of Basildon and Southend due to gains by Labour, independents and Liberal Democrats. But they will still be the main party of local government in the East. They held on to Castle Point, Brentwood and Rochford, and I would expect them to hold onto most of their other councils in the East. The smiles are on the faces of the Liberal Democrats.

How have the UK\\'s MEPs been coping with the ever-changing Brexit situation? It\\'s the last day of the European Parliament in Strasbourg before the elections in May, but there\\'s not much last-minute packing for the UK group of MEPs - they\\'ve been ready to go for nearly a month. When the UK voted to leave the EU, the country\\'s representatives in the European Parliament expected to be out of a job on 29 March. Instead they have watched two deadlines pass by as MPs in Westminster failed to agree on the withdrawal deal. Now a new Brexit date of 31 October means the UK is likely to take part in European elections on 23 May and some MEPs are eyeing an unexpected return to Europe. But job prospects there could be short-lived. Whenever the UK breaks the Brexit deadlock, they could be sent home. And if the prime minister succeeds in winning support for a deal before polling day, elections could be called off altogether. MEPs are used to a nomadic life, dividing their time between parliament sessions in Brussels and Strasbourg, as well as their home constituencies in the UK. But many of them feel recent months have taken an already unstable situation to extremes. Catherine Bearder, Liberal Democrat MEP, says: \"Life is never certain as a politician, but this is beyond anything I\\'ve ever seen before.\" The 70-year-old had been planning a quiet retirement - \"painting, gardening, doing yoga\" - but said she is back on an election footing now, determined to fight to keep the UK\\'s place at the European table. For Nathan Gill, a former UKIP and independent MEP who has now joined the newly launched Brexit Party, the delays have been a blow to the cause he spent the last 15 years of his life on. Speaking from an office filled with packing boxes, he says: \"It\\'s unbelievable, it\\'s disgraceful.\" He says he was forced to leave his Brussels apartment and move into a hotel after his lease ended. Later he got turfed out of there too. As UK Prime Minister Theresa May sought the latest extension to Brexit and an emergency EU summit rolled into town, prices rose so much that Mr Gill had to temporarily decamp to Antwerp, some 25 miles (41km) away. Every country in the EU elects representatives to the parliament, which meets in Strasbourg and Brussels. The UK has 73 MEPs, representing each of its 12 regions for five-year terms. Their job is to debate and to help decide on EU laws, as well as scrutinising the work of EU institutions. The last election saw 19 Conservatives elected, 20 from Labour and 24 from UKIP - although 19 UKIP MEPs have since left the party and one was expelled. The Greens have three MEPs, the SNP has two and there is one each from the Liberal Democrats, Democratic Unionist Party, Sinn Fein, the Ulster Unionist Party and Plaid Cymru. Labour\\'s David Martin is the UK\\'s longest-serving MEP, first elected in 1984. The Brexit Party is not the only new party planning to contest these European elections. Change UK - formed by former Labour and Tory MPs, initially under the name The Independent Group - says it had 3,700 people applying to be candidates. MEPs themselves will receive a transitional allowance when their term ends, equivalent to a month\\'s salary for every year they have served. But across the political spectrum, they are united in feeling that staff have been treated badly. Each MEP has a budget to hire assistants, with up to three in Brussels as well as staff in their home region. Information about the future for these staff members is scarce and always changing, MEPs say. Contracts could not be extended until Brexit extensions were officially confirmed by the European Council, usually at the last minute as negotiations went to the wire. For some staff, the last-minute deadline extensions meant losing redundancy pay as they had already accepted jobs elsewhere. Others who remain are sleeping on sofas as their apartment leases run out. \"It\\'s very brutal from a staff point of view,\" says Conservative MEP Daniel Dalton. \"You\\'re in one day and out the other and your staff are out with you.\" Green MEP Jean Lambert says staff had to be made redundant and offices closed as the original Brexit deadline loomed in March. But the party kept in place a contingency plan in case the UK took part in European elections. \"We\\'ve got a plan A and a plan B, which is more than the government has,\" she says - although she plans to retire as an elected representative. If the UK does elect MEPs, what will they do in a potentially short-lived return to Brussels and Strasbourg? Some Brexiteer politicians such as Nathan Gill warn that they plan to make the EU nations \"regret\" the UK MEPs\\' return. Mr Gill says the Brexit Party hopes to work with other anti-EU and anti-euro parties across the continent, such as the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) and Italy\\'s anti-immigration League party, to cause disruption. \"We want them to realise they should have just let us go,\" he says. \"They don\\'t need this thorn in their side.\" But Conservative MEP Mr Dalton, who backs the government\\'s Brexit withdrawal agreement, says it would be \"completely counter-productive\". He says British politicians have often failed to understand that the EU Parliament is based on compromise, so the adversarial politics of Westminster fall flat. \"All it does is annoy people,\" he says. \"They\\'re much more likely to get more stubborn.\" UKIP MEP Stuart Agnew is another who has postponed retirement to take part in the elections, if they happen. He says he was surprised that Westminster MPs had let the Brexit deadlock get to this point. \"I would have lost a bet. I thought they would have banged heads together, that the Conservatives wouldn\\'t want European elections and neither would Labour. I was wrong,\" he says. Other MEPs have made firm decisions not to stand again but have still been left bewildered by recent weeks. David Martin, Labour MEP, says he intends to do academic lecturing on the EU and trade policy, but had been struggling to agree a start date. \"The Brexit negotiations will be a really good case study in how not to negotiate with the European Union,\" he says. He has also been puzzling over a unique issue of etiquette: when should Brexiting MEPs say their goodbyes? As Mr Martin puts it: \"You don\\'t want to have a farewell dinner and say goodbye to everyone, and still be there the next day.\"'}, {'date': '2019-04-13', 'title': \"'Biggest' UK tulip grower stockpiles bulbs over Brexit\", 'content': 'The UK\\'s biggest outdoor commercial tulip grower has said it has been stockpiling bulbs as uncertainty over Brexit continues.

The company said it was \"delighted\" to hold talks with Mr Macpherson about the issue. \"Arla Foods has consistently expressed concern about the impact of any disruption associated with Brexit on our farmers, our consumers and our colleagues, and we are very happy to have the opportunity to discuss these issues with the minister during his visit,\" said a spokesperson. \"Across Arla we have around 500 European nationals who are valued members of our team, and EU citizens are also a very important part of the workforce on farms and across our supply chain. \"In addition to giving practical advice and support wherever we can we are committed to working with the minister and other stakeholders to ensure we are best-placed to retain the colleagues that we have, and maintain access to a motivated and skilled labour force in future, enabling us to continue to deliver much-loved dairy products to consumers across the UK.\"'}, {'date': '2019-05-03', 'title': 'Election results: Yvette Cooper blamed for Labour losses', 'content': 'A Labour councillor has blamed his party\\'s losses on MP Yvette Cooper, saying she \"wouldn\\'t know democracy if it scratched her in the eyeballs\".

The foreign secretary said the public would find it \"hugely disappointing\" to be asked to send MEPs to Brussels. Asked if it could be a disaster for the Tories, he told the BBC \"in terms of polling it certainly looks that way\". Some local Tory activists have signalled they will not campaign and regard the polls as a \"distraction\". Downing Street said that in order to avoid the need for elections, legislation implementing the Brexit withdrawal deal would have to be passed by Parliament by 22 May. Last week, the EU agreed a new Brexit deadline of 31 October. Talks between the government and Labour are set to continue over the Easter parliamentary recess in the hope of finding an agreement that will be acceptable to MPs. A series of working groups in key areas, such as environmental standards, security and workers\\' rights, have been set up to try and find common ground. Speaking on a visit to Japan, Mr Hunt said the talks with Labour had been \"more constructive than people thought\" but \"we don\\'t know if they are going to work\". If they did not lead anywhere, he suggested the government may \"need to find a way to rebuild the DUP-Conservative coalition\", which has come under real strain from Brexit. The Democratic Unionists are supposed to support the government in key parliamentary votes to give it a majority in the House of Commons. But they have refused to support the prime minister\\'s withdrawal agreement over concerns with the controversial Irish backstop, which aims to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland. Mr Hunt told BBC Radio 4\\'s Today programme that continuing Brexit \"paralysis\" would be \"highly damaging\" to the UK\\'s global standing and international trading partners \"are worried that we will become submerged in the mire of Brexit indecision\". While Japan and other major foreign investors were keen for the UK to \"make up its mind\" about Brexit, he suggested they would continue to keep faith with the UK even if it left without a deal. \"(Japan) has signed a deal with the EU and, in a no-deal situation, we hope that would roll over and apply for us, although no-deal, I think, is looking much less likely,\" he said. \"I think they are very keen to protect their trading relationship with the UK, but I think they are also wanting to talk to us about other things.\" However, in February, the government released a statement saying it would not be able to replicate the EU\\'s free trade deal with Japan after Brexit. And Japan has not agreed to continuing existing trade terms in the event of no deal. Mr Hunt downplayed talk of an imminent Conservative leadership contest, saying it would be a \"sidetrack\" from Brexit. The foreign secretary, along with his predecessor Boris Johnson, are among a long list of potential candidates touted to succeed Mrs May when she stands down. Asked whether the next leader could be someone, like himself, who campaigned to remain in the EU, Mr Hunt replied: \"There is one very big difference between me and Boris, which is that I am foreign secretary and I have a very big job to do to try and get this deal over the line and that has to be my focus. \"I think that what matters is we have a cabinet that believes in Brexit.\" On the first day of his trip to Japan, Mr Hunt met the country\\'s prime minister Shinzo Abe and other political leaders. He also took some time out of his political schedule to talk to pupils in a school in Tokyo. Mr Hunt is a fluent Japanese speaker, having taught English as a foreign language in Japan in his 20s.'}, {'date': '2019-04-11', 'title': 'Article 50: Can the UK revoke Brexit?', 'content': 'Prime Minister Theresa May has been granted another Brexit delay by European Union (EU) leaders with a new deadline date of 31 October. European Council President Donald Tusk said the UK should use the extra time to either pass the withdrawal agreement negotiated between the UK and the EU, rethink its strategy or \"cancel Brexit altogether.\" If the UK chose this last option, it would mean revoking something called Article 50. This is the part of the Lisbon Treaty which sets out what happens when a country decides that it wants to leave the EU. It was triggered by Theresa May on 29 March 2017, starting a two-year countdown to leaving - although this period has now been extended twice. A petition calling for Article 50 to be revoked - effectively cancelling Brexit - has been signed by more than six million people. But Theresa May has said that it should not be revoked. The European Court of Justice (ECJ) ruling last year confirmed that the UK could revoke Article 50 itself, without having to ask the other 27 EU countries for permission. This could be done by writing a letter to the European Council, made up of EU heads of state. The ECJ said the UK would then remain a member of the EU on the same terms - as it has now - including keeping its budget rebate. But it did set some conditions. The ruling said revocation should be \"unequivocal and unconditional\", suggesting that the UK could not simply revoke Article 50 in order to buy more time and then resubmit it at a later date. A senior lawyer at the ECJ said that \"appropriate legal instruments\" could be used if a member state tried to trigger and revoke Article 50 in order to secure a better withdrawal deal. Please upgrade your browser Use the list below or select a button Theresa May or Parliament? On this, the ECJ did not give a definitive answer. The court ruled that: \"Revocation must be decided following a democratic process in accordance with national constitutional requirements.\" The UK government has a power known as the Royal Prerogative, which allows it to do certain things including deploying armed forces, granting honours and altering international treaties without consulting Parliament. So it is possible in theory that Mrs May would be able to revoke Article 50 without giving MPs the chance to vote on it. But there are limits to that power, and those limits have been tested during the course of the Brexit process. Their use to activate the two year Article 50 negotiating period was challenged by Gina Miller at the beginning of 2017. The Supreme Court ruled in her case that the government could not trigger the EU exit process without bringing it before Parliament. Because an act of Parliament was required to trigger Article 50, it has been suggested revoking it would also need parliamentary approval. \"The balance of opinion is that the safest and most secure legal route is to enact a very short piece of legislation to authorise the prime minister to revoke,\" according to Kenneth Armstrong, professor of European law at the University of Cambridge. Although some lawyers believe a letter from the prime minister would do. That\\'s if Theresa May were to make the decision - but what if Parliament wanted to force her hand? They could potentially do this by taking control of Parliamentary business, as happened last month enabling Labour MP Yvette Cooper to pass legislation compelling the Prime Minister to seek a Brexit extension. In the same way, if there were a majority to do so, MPs might be able to instruct the Prime Minister to revoke Article 50.

Mr Tusk said the decision to delay Brexit to 31 October meant British voters would be going to the polls. But Brexit co-ordinator Guy Verhofstadt said the six-month extension was too short for change and too far away to prompt action. The UK PM has said she wants to leave the EU before 22 May to avoid the poll. But Theresa May needs to get her withdrawal deal - which has been rejected three times by Parliament - approved by MPs. Cross-party talks between the government and the Labour Party are continuing this week to find a way through the impasse. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said no agreement had been reached and the government \"doesn\\'t appear\" to be shifting its stance on key issues, including its opposition to a customs union with the EU. On the European elections, Mr Corbyn said he was \"very confident\" that Labour would win support for its message that the UK needed a close economic relationship with the EU. Elsewhere, in an interview with the Financial Times, Germany\\'s foreign minister Heiko Maas has said there will be no Brexit extension beyond October. \"They (the UK) will have to decide what they want by October,\" he said. \"You cannot drag out Brexit for a decade.\" Speaking in the European Parliament in Strasbourg, Mr Tusk insisted that if British MEPs were elected in May, they should be treated as \"full members\". \"One of the consequences of our decision is that the UK will hold European elections next month,\" he said. \"We should approach this seriously as UK members of the European Parliament will be there for several months - maybe longer.\" He said they will have \"all the rights and obligations\" of full members. \"I have strongly opposed the idea that during this further extension the UK should be treated as a second category member state. No, it cannot,\" he said. He said the EU had not given into \"fear and scaremongering\" that the UK would act in an obstructive way, saying the UK had been a \"responsible and constructive member state\". BBC Brussels correspondent Adam Fleming said this was a \"clear swipe\" at French President Emmanuel Macron and others who had warned the UK could disrupt the functioning of the EU during a long extension. The extension of Article 50 - the process by which the UK leaves the EU - gave the UK time to cancel its departure if that was what the British people wanted, Mr Tusk said. He said he knew both sides of the Channel were \"exhausted with Brexit\" and this should not be \"an excuse to say, \\'Let\\'s get it over with,\\' just because we are tired\". \"We must continue to deal with Brexit with an open mind and in a civilised manner,\" he said. European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker reiterated that there would be no renegotiation of the withdrawal agreement. \"Brexit is not the future of the EU,\" he said. \"The future of the union will go well beyond Brexit.\" The European Parliament\\'s Brexit co-ordinator Guy Verhofstadt said the extension risked importing the \"Brexit mess into the EU\" and \"poisoning\" the European Parliament elections. He urged the UK government and the Labour Party to reach a cross-party consensus in the \"coming days\". Works and Pensions Secretary Amber Rudd told BBC Radio 5 Live that \"leaving the EU is harder than a lot of people thought it was going to be\". She said the prime minister was right to request a Brexit delay and had \"done the right thing in reaching out to Labour\" for cross-party talks. \"You can\\'t just give up, you have to find a different approach,\" she said. Amid speculation about Theresa May\\'s future, Ms Rudd said it was \"entirely possible\" she could be a candidate in a future leadership election, telling BBC Radio 5 Live \"I don\\'t rule it out\". Earlier in the interview, she said: \"I\\'m not planning to run\" but \"I\\'ve kept the door slightly ajar.\"'}, {'date': '2019-04-12', 'title': 'Can the Tories and Labour agree on Brexit?', 'content': 'Cross-party talks are continuing in Whitehall, amid parliamentary deadlock over Theresa May\\'s Brexit deal. So what are the sticking points and can Labour and the Conservatives reach an agreement? Public statements on the talks have tended to be bland, ranging from \"constructive\" and \"serious\" to the slightly more negative: \"We have some way to travel.\" Behind the scenes, the prospect of a deal, while difficult, is not impossible. There is a big incentive for both sides to reach agreement: the avoidance of next month\\'s European elections. Prime Minister Theresa May doesn\\'t want to give a platform to parties such as Nigel Farage\\'s new project which could appeal to Brexit-voting Conservatives. And, frankly, some of her own activists would be conflicted over how, or whether, to vote. For Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, awkward questions about a second referendum could be ducked if there is no election campaign. So the talks are serious and not just political window dressing, and the fact that Mr Corbyn and Mrs May met on Thursday is significant. The Labour leader\\'s policy guru Andrew Fisher joined shadow chancellor John McDonnell for the cross-party talks on Friday. But, as I understand it, significant hurdles remain. Some of the detail of possible changes to the Political Declaration - the blueprint for the UK\\'s post-Brexit relationship with the EU - is being discussed. But sequencing is a problem. Labour wants to discuss legally binding changes to the document, future-proofing it, where possible, against a change of Conservative leader. Broadly speaking, the government would rather do \"the easy bit\" first - discussing legislation to protect  workers\\' rights. Resolving this tension is key to a deal. Labour is also keen to secure agreement on a customs union. It is flexible on what it would be called - an \"arrangement\", for example - and Mrs May hinted on Thursday that the two sides were close on this. But they are not yet close enough. The definition of what a customs union/arrangement does is vital to the Labour side. But the main constraints to a deal may come from Mrs May and Mr Corbyn\\'s parties, rather than their negotiators. If there is too much compromise on a customs union, Mrs May risks losing more cabinet ministers. For Mr Corbyn, the pressure from many Labour members is for him to exact a referendum, in return for passing the deal. So far, the prime minister isn\\'t budging on this. One way round this obstacle would be to hold a separate vote in Parliament on a referendum, possibly as an amendment to the forthcoming Withdrawal Agreement Bill. Both Mrs May and Mr Corbyn - who is not an enthusiast for a public vote - believe this would fall. But some of the Labour leader\\'s shadow ministers - including some who are firmly on the Left - are pushing for a referendum, or confirmatory ballot, to be tied explicitly to any Brexit deal. So, getting a deal passed would be totally dependent on approving a public vote at the same time. I am told shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer is pressing for a ballot to be part of any final package. If, in the end, these difficulties can\\'t be overcome then the hope is that both sides will at least agree a parliamentary process for discussing and voting on options which might finally break the deadlock.'}, {'date': '2019-04-13', 'title': 'Real divide is wealth not Brexit, says Jeremy Corbyn', 'content': 'The real divide in society is between rich and poor and not Brexit, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has told party members in Llandudno. At Welsh Labour conference Mr Corbyn said his party is trying to end the Commons deadlock on the issue. He said he did not want to pit remain voters in one part of the country against leave voters in another. Meanwhile Welsh Labour leader Mark Drakeford said Brexit should not be used to \"short-change\" Wales. He also announced £2.3m to offer sanitary products to all learners in schools and colleges. The Labour frontbench in Westminster is taking part in Brexit talks with Theresa May\\'s government. \"Only Labour has been consistently trying to find a way through the deadlock,\" Mr Corbyn said. \"Labour doesn\\'t believe the real divide in society is between people who voted to remain or to leave the European Union. \"We believe the real divide is between the many - who do the work, create the wealth and pay their taxes - and the few - who set the rules, reap the rewards and dodge their taxes.\" Labour does not want to \"set the hard up family in Cardiff that voted to remain, against the hard up family in Wrexham that voted to leave,\" Mr Corbyn said. The politician said people that believe leaving or remaining in the EU are ends in themselves are \"wrong\". \"The first question is what kind of society do we want to be,\" he said. \"On that we can find so much common ground.\" Mr Corbyn said the previous weeks in politics had been \"intense\" and that the Westminster political system had not come out of it well. He said it was \"scandalous\" that the offer of talks on Brexit had come so late from the PM. His party will continue to talk to the government, the leader said, to abide by the result of the referendum without \"wrecking our economy\". But if that is not possible all options should remain on the table, including a public vote, Mr Corbyn said to applause from delegates. There are calls in his party for another referendum on whether the UK should leave the EU. In his conference speech, Mr Drakeford told delegates that Theresa May was the \"first Prime Minister in history to fall on her own sword - and then to miss it\". The Welsh Labour leader accused the Conservative party of being \"wrapped and trapped by a mythical nostalgia for a past remembered only by its ever diminishing membership\". In a speech which did not mention a further referendum, Mr Drakeford said \"the chaos of Brexit\" is seen as an opportunity for Mr Cairns \"to grow his own office\". \"So let me issue this very clear warning to the Secretary of State for Wales,\" Mr Drakeford said, referring to Alun Cairns. The AM for Cardiff West said if Mr Cairns \"continues to persist in using the so-called UK Shared Prosperity Fund\" - which is aimed to replace EU funds - \"as a means of by-passing the National Assembly, as a way of using Brexit to short-change the people of Wales, then he is heading for a fight\". The FM said EU funds must be replaced, and devolved powers kept: \"Not a penny less, not a power lost\". Currently EU funds in Wales are spent by a body of the Welsh Government. Last year Theresa May would not confirm if the new fund would be devolved. Mr Drakeford said he had a \"simple message\" to voters and Labour members on the European elections, saying they should be taken as seriously as a general election. \"You will be told that these elections are meaningless; that it\\'s not worth bothering to turn out to campaign or not even bothering to vote,\" he said. \"Please do not believe it.\" Analysis by Felicity Evans, BBC Wales political editor Mark Drakeford\\'s first speech as Welsh Labour leader was well received in the hall, and contained a popular policy announcement on combating period poverty. But it was curiously retrospective given that Mr Drakeford only took up the reins of government in December. Perhaps that\\'s because it was also, undoubtedly, an appeal for party unity at a time when Brexit is turning both main UK parties upside down and inside out. There was the promise of legislation on fair working and a call to delegates to front up in the event that elections to the European Parliament take place next month. But the divisive issue of another Brexit referendum? That was the proverbial elephant in the room. New Labour MP Ruth Jones, who won the Newport West by-election last week, gave the welcome address at conference, telling delegates that in devolution\\'s 20th year \"our task is to stand up for the people of Wales\". \"People have had enough after a decade of austerity,\" she said, calling it a \"political choice, not a financial one\". Shadow Welsh Secretary Christina Rees appealed \"for calmness in a country that is divided because of the inexplicable way the prime minister has handled the Brexit negotiations\". She said language in emails and on social media had become \"intimidating\", and had reported the worst cases to the police. \"It\\'s changed from \\'I\\'m writing to tell you I don\\'t agree with you\\' to \\'you\\'re a traitor, letting down people who voted for you\\',\" she said.'}, {'date': '2019-04-10', 'title': 'Brexit: Why a long extension worries Europe', 'content': 'The president of the European Council, Donald Tusk, has urged European Union leaders not to humiliate Theresa May when they discuss her latest request to delay Brexit. But the other 27 EU countries (known as the EU27) may still impose tough conditions on any extension to the Article 50 negotiating period, to ensure that they protect their own interests. The EU\\'s main initial demand is that the UK fulfils its commitment to hold European Parliament elections on 23 May, if Brexit hasn\\'t happened by then. Draft conclusions for today\\'s summit in Brussels say that if the UK were to fail to hold the elections, it would automatically leave the EU - without a deal if necessary - on 1 June. But even if those elections take place, and UK MEPs attend the first session of the new parliament in July, there is still concern in some quarters that a disgruntled British government could prevent the EU making progress on a series of important issues. Different member states have different opinions on how serious a threat this is. But it is certainly an important part of the discussion. Theresa May has already pledged that the UK will remain a \"constructive and responsible\" member state, and abide by its \"duty of sincere co-operation\" with the rest of the EU. This is a form of words that carries weight in Brussels, but it doesn\\'t bind any future UK government to act in the same way. The EU has a series of big decisions to make in the coming months. It doesn\\'t want Brexit to get in the way. To begin with, there is a changing of the guard at the top of the EU\\'s political structures. A new president of the European Commission has to be nominated by EU leaders, and approved by the European Parliament, in time to take over on 1 November from Jean-Claude Juncker, who is standing down. A month later, on 1 December, a new European Council president will take office, succeeding Donald Tusk. Both of these appointment, though, involve qualified majority voting - in other words they don\\'t have to be approved unanimously by all member states. That would limit the ability of an unhappy UK government to block critical EU business. \"We\\'ve looked very carefully,\" a senior EU official says, \"and in reality there aren\\'t many things you can veto over the coming year.\" But there are other important issues looming for the EU notably on the size and shape of the next seven year budget for 2021-27. Negotiations on the budget will start to intensify under the new Commission, although final decisions won\\'t be made for at least a year. The budget does need unanimous approval. That is one of the reasons why any Brexit extension will almost certainly, as Mr Tusk has suggested, be \"no longer than a year\". Brexit has been taking up far too much time already. It has diverted the EU from a focus on other subjects, and the leaders of the EU27 would rather concentrate on their own future than on the internal debates of a country that is trying to leave. So the leaders will have to decide how many conditions they impose on a Brexit extension, and they will want to hear Mrs May repeat her written pledge of co-operation in person. Throughout the Brexit process, the unity of the EU27 has been a consistent factor. But there is now a difficult balance to strike. Does there need to be a formal review process during an extension, or is a European Council decision to \"remain seized of the matter\" (EU jargon for paying close attention to it) enough? \"I think the extension should be as short as possible,\" German Chancellor Angela Merkel told the German parliament. \"But it should be long enough to create calm, so we don\\'t have to meet every two weeks to talk about the same subject,\" she added.

That was more or less the prime minister's message to MPs in the Commons today. We've all just lived through a historic political period when the levels of anger and anxiety and frustration and fury have gone up and up and up and up in Westminster, and maybe beyond. Up until this moment, the prime minister has simply been unable to deliver the support for her compromise deal with the EU. Parliament has not managed to agree a consensus around anything else. And both sides - for it has felt like the Executive versus the Commons - have become more and more irritated as time has ticked down towards this week's deadline. The Brexit delay that the EU has agreed gives Westminster's village a pause, a moment to take a breath, and maybe to take stock. The EU has placed a little faith in the idea that there could be a cross-party compromise. Whispers suggest that ministers will meet Labour counterparts on Friday and are telling business leaders tonight that there could be a bespoke deal for the UK, if those cross-party talks can deliver. So, the screaming alarm, warning against leaving with no deal in a few hours' time, has been silenced, at least for now. And while there is, inevitably, rising chatter about ushering Theresa May out of office, it seems clear that none of the candidates who would love to replace her, want to be the person to take over right now. Whether it is Dominic Raab, Boris Johnson, Jeremy Hunt, Liz Truss, or someone else on the long list of potential candidates, none appear on the point of jumping forward to say: 'This is a slow-motion disaster, I have a better idea.' Ironically, none of the people at the top levels of the Tory Party who believe they could lead, want to do it at this moment - where arguably, leadership has never been so in demand. The prime minister won a delay, and got through yet another bumpy session in Parliament on Thursday without too much harm. But the policy clashes, the battle of ideas, and yes, the grudge matches, have not been played out to their conclusion. For Brexit therefore, and for all of us, there is no sign of conclusion.

Read more from Laura here. MPs have yet to agree on a deal for leaving the European Union, and, as a result, the deadline of Brexit has been pushed back from 29 March to 31 October. While local elections give voters the chance to choose the decision-makers who affect their communities, the national issue has loomed large on the doorstep. Mrs May, appearing at the Welsh Conservative conference, said voters had sent the \"simple message\" that her party and Labour had to \"get on\" with delivering Brexit. \"These were always going to be difficult elections for us,\" the prime minister added, \"and there were some challenging results for us last night, but it was a bad night for Labour, too.\" A heckler shouted at the prime minister: \"Why don\\'t you resign?\" He was then ushered out of the conference hall in Llangollen, North Wales, as the audience chanted: \"Out, out, out.\" BBC political correspondent Iain Watson said that while the Conservatives had lost \"more than 10 times as many councillors\", it was \"remarkable\" that Labour, \"around the mid-term of a not-very-popular government - has not made net gains\". Speaking in Greater Manchester, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said he \"wanted to do better\" and conceded voters who disagreed with its backing for Brexit had deserted the party. But Lib Dem leader Sir Vince, attending a rally in Chelmsford, Essex, where his party took control of the council, said it had been a \"brilliant\" result and that \"every vote for the Liberal Democrats was a vote for stopping Brexit\". The BBC projects that, if the local election results it analysed were replicated across Britain, both the Conservatives and Labour would get 28% of the total vote. The data, based on 650 wards in which detailed voting figures were collected, suggests the Lib Dems would get 19% and other parties and independents 25%. Polling expert Prof Sir John Curtice said the days of the Conservatives and Labour dominating the electoral landscape, as happened in the 2017 election when they won 80% of the vote between them, \"may be over\". He said it was only the second time in history that the two main parties\\' projected national share of the vote had fallen below 30%. The only other occasion was in 2013, when UKIP performed strongly in local elections. Prof Curtice also said the Conservatives and Labour had both lost ground since last year\\'s local elections when both were estimated to be on 35%. While the Lib Dem figure was the highest since 2010, when they agreed to join the coalition government with the Conservatives, he said it was still well below the 24% the party regularly achieved in the 1990s and 2000s. Green Party co-leader Sian Berry told the BBC the Greens were not simply benefiting from a protest vote over Brexit - their gains reflected \"huge new concerns\" about climate change as well as the strength of their local campaigning on a range of issues. For UKIP, Lawrence Webb, a former London mayoral candidate who is standing in this month\\'s European elections, said the party\\'s \"fortunes were on the up\", despite the fall in its number of councillors. This is the biggest set of local elections in England\\'s four-year electoral cycle, with more than 8,400 seats being contested. A further 462 seats are up for grabs in Northern Ireland. Six mayoral elections have also taken place, with Labour\\'s Jamie Driscoll winning the contest to become the first ever North of Tyne mayor. Labour candidates also won in Leicester and Mansfield but the party out lost to independents in Middlesbrough and Copeland.

The Daily Express calls it a \"cosy video chat\" to the nation about the need to find a compromise deal. However, her message has infuriated Tory hardliners who believe she is set to rip up her Brexit red lines and build a softer divorce deal based on a customs union with the EU, the paper says. The Guardian says that while the \"homespun video\" was praised for its conversational style, there are increasing expectations that the cross-party talks will come to nothing. The Metro, meanwhile, describes the film as \"awkward\". Get news from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning Writing in the Daily Telegraph, former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson says agreeing to a customs union would be a big step towards what he calls \"economic serfdom\" and would abandon the central logic of Brexit. But the Daily Mail says that while a customs union would be a \"bitter pill to swallow\" changes could be made once the UK is out of the EU. However, it implores Mrs May to stay true to one of her conditions - and continue to rule out a second referendum. Meanwhile, President Emmanuel Macron of France is leading demands for Britain to accept tough political conditions as the price for any extension to the Brexit deadline, according to the Financial Times. The paper says he doesn\\'t want Britain to use its continuing presence to disrupt the bloc\\'s business including its multi-year budget. There\\'s a broad welcome for the government\\'s proposals to improve internet safety. The Sun says the crackdown on what it calls the \"social media Wild West\" is better late than never. But it warns that the plans must have teeth and says sites that can\\'t be controlled should be shut down altogether. The Daily Telegraph says the white paper offers tech firms the chance to recognise their duties and act responsibly. If they don\\'t, they could find themselves facing far tougher laws. For the Daily Mail, efforts to make tech giants directly responsible for the safety of their users are laudable. However, it warns against the dangers of stifling free speech, saying the laws must be tightly framed to ensure it cannot be used by the state to control public debate. Several papers carry he smiling face of a jubilant James Cracknell on front pages. \"Cracked it,\" is the Daily Mail\\'s headline, as it recounts the double Olympic champion\\'s feat at becoming, at the age of 46, the oldest Boat Race winner in history as part of the Cambridge crew. \"Old Man River in the medals again,\" is the Daily Telegraph\\'s take. For the Guardian, he was simply: \"Oarsome.\"'}, {'date': '2019-04-12', 'title': 'Brexit: Welsh resorts to \\'benefit\" from EU exit uncertainty', 'content': 'Holidaymakers look set to embrace staycations in Wales this year as Brexit sparks nervousness about European holidays, tourism chiefs say. The Easter holidays were due to be the first break after Britain left the European Union, before the government delayed the initial 29 March deadline. Tourism bosses say the weak pound and uncertainty could add to the 10 million annual overnight trips to Wales. The Wales Tourism Alliance is positive there will be a \"Brexit bounce\". The drop in the value of the pound has made foreign holidays more expensive and many operators in Wales are reporting greater interest as 2019\\'s holiday season begins at the Easter break. About 90% of overnight trippers to Wales are from the UK staycation market and that could rise with a scorching summer similar to last year. \"People are understandably nervous about going to Europe,\" said Andrew Campbell, chairman of the Wales Tourism Alliance. \"There is also a lot of uncertainty and people are holding on to their cash.\" The alliance, which represents more than 7,000 businesses, spoke to delegates in Pembrokeshire on Friday about the \"opportunities\" for Welsh tourism because of Brexit. \"Since the decision was made to leave the EU, the tourism industry has benefited,\" said Pembrokeshire Tourism liaison manager Dennis O\\'Conner. \"We have received lots of international visitors because the pound is so low and more and more people are looking at staycations.\" One holiday letting company, FBM Holidays, which has 300 properties across west Wales, is preparing for its busiest year for three years, while the 350-cottage Bluestone resort is already ahead of its 2018 summer occupancy rate with three months remaining. The Caravan Club in Wales, as well as across the rest of the UK, has recorded its best quarter in a decade while bookings at Mark Whitehouse\\'s holiday park in Fishguard is up 25% for this summer. \"It has given us a small window of opportunity to introduce new customers to UK tourism,\" he said. \"The hysteria will settle down and people will start going abroad again but hopefully we will retain a proportion of them.\" There is also a feeling in the industry that some holidaymakers are waiting to see the impact of Brexit before booking their summer break. \"People are holding their breath to see if there is going to be any impact on their income before they book their holidays,\" said Pembrokeshire Tourism chair Jane Rees-Baynes, who runs Elm Grove Country House near Tenby. \"People maybe waiting to see if they need to worry about passport queues and things like car insurance on the continent. It will be a lot more last minute this year.\"'}, {'date': '2019-04-09', 'title': 'Brexit delay proves lesser evil for May', 'content': \"The request for delay is an answer to one question. When confronted with the possibility of taking the UK out of the EU without a formal deal in place or slamming on the brakes, which way would the prime minister jump? Would she choose a pure plan - pursuing Brexit over the risk of instability? Or would Theresa May heed the voices of warning, rather than those in her own party arguing that any short-term pain would be worth long-term gain, and ask for delay, despite the embarrassment of doing so, and the frustration of those who wanted her to keep the promise of leaving on time? Mrs May kept many in Westminster guessing for a long time. But her meetings in Europe, her plea on Tuesday, are evidence of the decision she finally took - that almost any entreaties to European leaders are worth it to avoid opening Pandora's Box. Pausing again brings embarrassment and angers many on her own side, but it's a lesser evil than departing with no deal. If the prime minister is granted a strings-attached delay later, the next question is perhaps as big. What will she do with the extra time she's been granted? Will it even be up to her? Cross-party talks with the Labour Party are serious - both sides in the room are taking part in good faith and expect more negotiations on Thursday. But the more talking they do, the more the scale of the task to bring them together reveals itself. Forget a quick solution from this joint process, and don't bank on one happening at all. The divisions may simply be too great - the moment when it might have worked perhaps has passed. If that fails, then the answer may pass again, back to Parliament - MPs confronted again with the power to choose from a wide array of different choices - with the ability, if not yet the common purpose to choose a version of Brexit for all of us. And of course, if a long delay is agreed it could push hungry Tories who want a change of leadership again into action. But the obvious response to another question is crystal clear - who is in charge for today? It's the EU leaders who will determine the date and nature of this delay - not the country that voted in an effort to pull back control.\"}]\n"
